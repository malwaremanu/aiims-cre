## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **What is AIIMS?**

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is a group of autonomous government public medical universities of higher education. It was established in 1956 through an Act of Parliament and is governed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. AIIMS, New Delhi, is the parent institution and is consistently ranked as the top medical college in India.

**Key Features of AIIMS:**
*   **Mission:** To provide high-quality patient care, train medical and paramedical professionals, and conduct advanced research.
*   **Structure:** AIIMS institutions are designated as "Institutions of National Importance." They have a tripartite mission of **teaching, research, and patient care**.
*   **Autonomy:** They are autonomous bodies, which allows them to have their own curriculum, standards, and operational policies, ensuring a high standard of excellence.
*   **Network:** From one institution in New Delhi, AIIMS has expanded to numerous locations across India, including Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur, and Rishikesh, among others.

### **What is the AIIMS Common Recruitment Examination (CRE)?**

The AIIMS Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) is a centralized, computer-based test conducted by AIIMS, New Delhi, for filling various Group B and C non-medical posts across all AIIMS institutions. The primary goal of CRE is to streamline the recruitment process, making it efficient, transparent, and standardized.

**Diagram: The AIIMS CRE Process (Explained in Words)**

1.  **Central Notification:** AIIMS, New Delhi, releases a single advertisement for multiple posts across various AIIMS locations.
2.  **Common Application:** Candidates fill out one application form, choosing their preferred posts and AIIMS locations.
3.  **Standardized Examination:** All candidates for a specific post appear for the same examination paper, ensuring a level playing field.
4.  **Merit-Based Allocation:** Based on the rank obtained in the CRE and the preferences submitted, candidates are allocated to different AIIMS institutions.

This system simplifies the process for applicants who would otherwise have to apply separately to each AIIMS.

### **The Role of a Psychiatric Social Worker at AIIMS**

A Psychiatric Social Worker (PSW) is a vital member of the multidisciplinary mental health team. At an institution like AIIMS, the role is demanding and requires a high degree of professional competence. The PSW serves as a bridge between the patient, their family, and the medical team.

**Core Responsibilities:**

| **Responsibility Area** | **Specific Tasks** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Psychosocial Assessment** | Conducting detailed interviews with patients and families to gather information about their social, economic, and emotional background. Identifying stressors and support systems. |
| **Counselling & Therapy** | Providing individual, group, and family therapy. Using therapeutic techniques to help patients cope with their illness and improve functioning. |
| **Case Management** | Coordinating with doctors, nurses, psychologists, and occupational therapists to create a comprehensive care plan. |
| **Community Linkages** | Connecting patients and families with community resources, such as rehabilitation centers, vocational training programs, and government welfare schemes. |
| **Advocacy** | Advocating for the rights of patients with mental illness and working to reduce stigma. |
| **Documentation** | Maintaining detailed and confidential records of all patient interactions and interventions. |

The role requires a strong foundation in social work principles, psychological theories, and an understanding of the mental health legal framework in India.

## **Real-life Examples or Case Applications**

**Case Scenario:**
A 25-year-old male patient is admitted to the psychiatry ward at AIIMS with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He has lost his job and his family is distressed.

*   **PSW's Intervention:**
    1.  **Assessment:** The PSW meets the family to understand their financial situation, their understanding of the illness, and the level of support they can provide.
    2.  **Psychoeducation:** The PSW conducts sessions with the family to educate them about schizophrenia, the importance of medication adherence, and how to manage challenging behaviors.
    3.  **Counselling:** The PSW provides supportive counselling to the patient to help him deal with the emotional turmoil of his diagnosis and job loss.
    4.  **Resource Mobilization:** The PSW connects the family with a local NGO that provides vocational training for persons with mental illness and informs them about the disability pension scheme.
    5.  **Discharge Planning:** Before discharge, the PSW works with the family and the patient to create a relapse prevention plan.

This case illustrates how a PSW's role extends beyond the hospital to ensure the patient's successful reintegration into the community.
