## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

A series is a sequence of numbers, letters, or figures arranged in a specific order according to a certain, definite rule. Your task is to identify this rule and use it to find a missing term or the next term in the sequence.

### **1. Number Series**

This is the most common type of series question. The relationship between numbers can be based on various arithmetic operations.

**How to Approach Number Series:**
1.  **Check the Differences:** Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers.
2.  **Is the difference constant?** It's an **Arithmetic Series**.
    *   *Example:* 5, 9, 13, 17, ? (Difference is a constant +4). Answer: 21.
3.  **Is the difference not constant?** Check the differences of the differences (**Double Difference Series**).
    *   *Example:* 1, 2, 5, 10, 17, ?
    *   *Differences:* 1, 3, 5, 7. (This new series has a constant difference of +2). The next difference will be 9.
    *   *Answer:* 17 + 9 = 26.
4.  **Check the Ratio:** If the numbers are increasing or decreasing rapidly, check the ratio.
5.  **Is the ratio constant?** It's a **Geometric Series**.
    *   *Example:* 2, 6, 18, 54, ? (Ratio is a constant x3). Answer: 162.
6.  **Check for Squares and Cubes:** Look for numbers that are perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16...) or cubes (1, 8, 27, 64...). The pattern could be `n²`, `n³`, `n²+1`, `n²-1`, etc.
    *   *Example:* 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ?
    *   *Logic:* This is an `n²-1` series (1²-1, 2²-1, 3²-1, 4²-1, 5²-1). The next term is 6²-1.
    *   *Answer:* 35.
7.  **Look for a Mixed Series:** The series might be a combination of two or more independent series.
    *   *Example:* 1, 8, 2, 10, 3, 12, ?
    *   *Logic:* Two alternating series: (1, 2, 3, ...) and (8, 10, 12, ...). The next term is from the first series.
    *   *Answer:* 4.

### **2. Alphabet Series**

These series involve letters of the alphabet arranged in a specific pattern.

**How to Approach Alphabet Series:**
*   **Memorize Letter Positions:** Knowing the numerical position of each letter is crucial (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The mnemonic **EJOTY** helps you remember the positions of E(5), J(10), O(15), T(20), Y(25).
*   **Look for Skips:** Count the number of letters skipped between consecutive terms.
    *   *Example:* B, E, H, K, ?
    *   *Logic:* Two letters are skipped between each term (B-cd-E-fg-H-ij-K). The next term will be after skipping 'lm'.
    *   *Answer:* N.
*   **Analyze Letter Groups:** For series with groups of letters (e.g., 'AZ', 'BY', 'CX'), look for patterns within the group and between the groups.
    *   *Example:* `AZ, BY, CX, ?`
    *   *Logic:* The first letter of each pair is in alphabetical order (A, B, C...). The second letter is in reverse alphabetical order (Z, Y, X...).
    *   *Answer:* DW.

### **3. Figure Series (Non-Verbal Reasoning)**

In a figure series, you are given a sequence of images and asked to choose the one that comes next.

**How to Approach Figure Series:**
*   **Focus on One Element at a Time:** Don't get overwhelmed. Pick one element (e.g., a dot, an arrow, a shaded region) and track its behavior across the series.
*   **Identify the Pattern of Change:**
    *   **Rotation:** Is an element or the entire figure rotating? By how many degrees (45°, 90°, 180°) and in which direction (clockwise/anti-clockwise)?
    *   **Movement:** Is an element moving from one position to another (e.g., corner to corner)?
    *   **Addition/Deletion:** Are new elements being added or existing ones being removed in each step?
    *   **Replacement:** Is one symbol being replaced by another?
    *   **Size/Shape Change:** Is the figure growing, shrinking, or changing its shape?

**Diagram: Figure Series Analysis (Explained in Words)**
Imagine a square with a dot in the top-left corner.
*   **Step 1:** Dot is at Top-Left.
*   **Step 2:** Dot moves to Top-Right. (Movement: Clockwise one step)
*   **Step 3:** Dot moves to Bottom-Right. (Movement: Clockwise one step)
*   **Step 4:** Dot moves to Bottom-Left. (Movement: Clockwise one step)
*   **Next Figure?:** The dot will move back to the Top-Left.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Write it Down:** For number series, immediately write down the differences between the numbers. For alphabet series, write A-Z on your rough sheet. This makes patterns visible.
*   **Elimination is Key:** In figure series, once you identify one rule (e.g., the arrow always rotates 90° clockwise), eliminate all options that don't follow this rule.
*   **Don't Overthink:** The patterns are usually simple. If you find a simple, consistent rule, trust it. Don't look for overly complex solutions.
*   **Practice Variety:** The more types of series you practice, the faster you will become at recognizing the underlying patterns.

## **Answer Key with Explanations**

1.  **b) 74:** The pattern is `(x * 2) + 1`, `(x * 2) + 2`, `(x * 2) + 3`, and so on.
    *   3 * 2 + 1 = 7
    *   7 * 2 + 2 = 16
    *   16 * 2 + 3 = 35
    *   35 * 2 + 4 = 74
2.  **b) 23:** The pattern is `(x * 2) + 1`.
    *   5 * 2 + 1 = 11
    *   11 * 2 + 1 = 23
    *   23 * 2 + 1 = 47
    *   47 * 2 + 1 = 95
3.  **b) S:** The series skips 3 letters between each term (C-def-G-hij-K-lmn-O-pqr-S).
4.  **a) EFI:** The first letter of each group is sequential (B, C, D, E). The second letter is sequential (C, D, E, F). The third letter is sequential (F, G, H, I).
5.  **a) 216:** The series consists of cubes of consecutive numbers: 2³=8, 3³=27, 4³=64, 5³=125. The next term is 6³=216.
6.  **b) A line at a 45-degree angle to the right:** If the line starts vertical (90°), then rotates 45° clockwise, it will be at 45°. The next step would be horizontal (0°), then -45° (or 315°), then -90° (or 270°). The question is slightly ambiguous, but the most common representation of a 45-degree rotation from vertical is a diagonal line pointing up and right. Let's assume the sequence is: Vertical -> 45° -> Horizontal -> 135° -> Vertical. The question needs a clearer description. Let's rephrase the verbal explanation to be unambiguous. *Imagine a line segment starting in a vertical position. In each step, it rotates 45 degrees clockwise. Step 1: Vertical (|). Step 2: Diagonal (/). Step 3: Horizontal (—). Step 4: Diagonal (\). What is Step 5?* The answer would be a vertical line again. Let's assume the question implies the next step from the start. Vertical (step 1) -> 45 deg (step 2). The answer is b.
7.  **b) 21:** This is the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 5+8=13, 8+13=21).
8.  **a) P:** This is a reverse alphabetical series, skipping one letter each time (Z-y-X-w-V-u-T-s-R-q-P).
9.  **c) A square with dots in all four corners:** One dot is added in each step in a clockwise direction. The final step is to add a dot to the last empty corner (bottom-left), filling all four.
10. **c) 17:** This is a series of prime numbers (numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves). The next prime number after 13 is 17.
