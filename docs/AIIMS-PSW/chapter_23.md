# **Chapter 23: Public Opinion, Crowd Behaviour & Social Influence**

## **Learning Objectives**

Upon completing this chapter, you will be able to:
*   Define public opinion and understand the factors that shape it.
*   Describe the characteristics of crowd behaviour, including the concept of deindividuation.
*   Define social influence and differentiate between conformity, compliance, and obedience.
*   Explain the significance of Asch's conformity experiment and Milgram's obedience experiment.
*   Apply these concepts to understand group dynamics and the power of social situations.

## **Exam Relevance**

*   **Mark Weight:** High. The concepts of conformity, obedience, and deindividuation are classic and foundational topics in social psychology. Expect 2-3 questions on these, especially related to the Asch and Milgram experiments.
*   **Topic Category:** Subject Knowledge - Social Psychology.
*   **Importance:** Critical. These concepts explain how individuals behave in group settings and under pressure from authority. This is crucial for understanding everything from patient compliance to large-scale social movements.

## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Public Opinion**

**Public Opinion** refers to the collective attitudes, beliefs, and views of a significant number of people on a particular issue or topic of public interest.

*   **Formation:** It is shaped by a variety of forces, including:
    *   Mass Media (Agenda-Setting)
    *   Opinion Leaders (influential people)
    *   Personal Experiences
    *   Family, peer groups, and social environment.
*   **Measurement:** Public opinion is most commonly measured through **opinion polls** and **surveys**, which use sampling techniques to estimate the views of the broader population.

### **Crowd Behaviour**

A **crowd** is a temporary, unstructured gathering of people who share a common focus of attention. The psychology of an individual can change dramatically when they are part of a crowd.

**Deindividuation:** This is the most important concept for understanding crowd behaviour.
*   **Definition:** Deindividuation is a psychological state characterized by a **loss of self-awareness and sense of personal responsibility**, which can occur when a person is part of a large group.
*   **Causes:** The main cause is the feeling of **anonymity** within the crowd. When people feel they cannot be personally identified, they are more likely to shed their normal inhibitions.
*   **Effect:** It can lead to impulsive, deviant, and sometimes violent behavior (e.g., riots, mob violence) because individuals feel less accountable for their actions.

### **Social Influence: Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience**

**Social Influence** is the process by which the actions of an individual or group affect the behavior of others.

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Nature of Pressure** | **Classic Study** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conformity** | Changing one's behavior or beliefs to match those of others in a group. | **Implicit Group Pressure**. There is no direct command. | **Asch's Line Experiment** |
| **Compliance** | Changing one's behavior in response to a **direct request** from another person. | An explicit request, but not from an authority figure. | (Various sales techniques) |
| **Obedience** | Changing one's behavior in response to a **direct command** from an **authority figure**. | An explicit command from someone with perceived authority. | **Milgram's Shock Experiment**|

#### **Classic Study 1: Asch's Conformity Experiment (1950s)**

*   **Setup:** A participant was placed in a room with several other people (who were secretly actors). They were all shown a standard line and then three comparison lines and asked to state which of the three lines matched the standard line. The answer was always obvious.
*   **Procedure:** On several trials, the actors all deliberately gave the same wrong answer.
*   **Result:** A significant number of participants **conformed** to the group's obviously wrong answer, rather than stating the correct answer they knew to be true.
*   **Conclusion:** This experiment demonstrated the power of **group pressure** and the human desire to fit in.

#### **Classic Study 2: Milgram's Obedience Experiment (1960s)**

*   **Setup:** Participants were told they were in a study about learning. They were assigned the role of "teacher" and were instructed to deliver an electric shock to a "learner" (an actor) in another room every time the learner made a mistake.
*   **Procedure:** The "teacher" was instructed by an authority figure (an experimenter in a lab coat) to increase the shock level with each mistake. The learner would pretend to be in increasing pain, eventually screaming and then falling silent.
*   **Result:** A shockingly high percentage of participants (around 65%) **obeyed** the authority figure and delivered the maximum, seemingly lethal, level of shock.
*   **Conclusion:** This experiment demonstrated the powerful, and potentially dangerous, influence of **obedience to authority**. Ordinary people are capable of doing harmful things when instructed by someone they perceive as a legitimate authority figure.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Conformity vs. Obedience:** This is a crucial distinction. **Conformity** is yielding to unspoken group pressure. **Obedience** is yielding to a direct command from an authority.
*   **Asch = Conformity:** Associate the **Asch** experiment with **conformity** and the line-judging task.
*   **Milgram = Obedience:** Associate the **Milgram** experiment with **obedience** to authority and the shock generator.
*   **Deindividuation = Anonymity:** The key to deindividuation is the feeling of anonymity in a crowd, which leads to a loss of personal responsibility.

## **Answer Key with Explanations**

1.  **c) Deindividuation:** This is the precise definition of the term—losing one's sense of individual identity within a group.
2.  **b) Conformity:** Asch's study demonstrated how people will conform to a group's opinion, even when it is obviously wrong.
3.  **a) Obedience to authority:** Milgram's study was designed specifically to test how far people would go in obeying instructions from an authority figure.
4.  **c) Obedience:** A police officer is a figure of authority, and they are giving a direct command.
5.  **b) Conformity:** The teenager is changing their behavior to match the implicit pressure and norms of their peer group.
6.  **b) A sense of anonymity:** Feeling anonymous and unidentifiable is the key factor that leads to the loss of personal responsibility in a crowd.
7.  **c) The situation and the presence of an authority figure can be powerful influences on behavior.** Milgram's study showed that the social situation, particularly the pressure from authority, could lead ordinary people to act in extraordinary and harmful ways.
8.  **c) Opinion polls and surveys:** These are the standard tools used by researchers and media to gauge public opinion on various issues.
9.  **b) Compliance:** This is a change in behavior in response to a direct request from a peer (your friend), not a command from an authority or pressure from a group.
10. **b) A direct command from an authority figure:** Conformity is about yielding to unspoken group pressure, while obedience is about following an explicit order from someone in power.
