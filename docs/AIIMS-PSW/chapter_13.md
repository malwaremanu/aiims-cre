## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **What is Social Policy?**

**Social Policy** refers to the plans, principles, and actions of government aimed at addressing social problems and meeting the needs of the population. It is the formal "blueprint" that guides the creation of social welfare programs and services.

*   **Purpose:** To improve societal well-being, promote social justice, and create a safety net for citizens.
*   **Examples:** The National Health Policy, the National Education Policy, the National Policy for the Empowerment of Women.

#### **Models of Social Policy**

There are two primary models for how social policy is viewed and implemented:

1.  **The Residual Model:**
    *   **View:** Social welfare is seen as a temporary safety net that should only come into play when the two "natural" systems for meeting needs—the **family** and the **market** (jobs)—fail.
    *   **Approach:** It is targeted, selective, and often carries a stigma. It is for the "deserving poor."
    *   **Example:** A food bank for the homeless.

2.  **The Institutional Model:**
    *   **View:** Social welfare is seen as a normal, permanent, and necessary "first-line" function of a modern industrial society. It is a right of citizenship.
    *   **Approach:** It is universal, available to everyone regardless of their wealth or status.
    *   **Example:** A public education system or a universal healthcare service like the NHS in the UK.

### **Social Security: A Deeper Look**

**Social Security** consists of public programs intended to protect workers and their families from income losses associated with unemployment, old age, sickness, disability, or death. It is a key component of social policy.

There are two main types of social security:

**Table: Social Assistance vs. Social Insurance**

| **Feature** | **Social Assistance** | **Social Insurance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eligibility** | Based on **need**. Applicants must prove they are poor (this is called a "means test"). | Based on **contribution**. It is an earned right. |
| **Financing** | From general government tax revenues. | From contributions by employees, employers, and sometimes the state. |
| **Nature** | Seen as a form of public charity or welfare. | Seen as a right, like any other insurance policy. |
| **Examples in India** | National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) which includes old age pensions (IGNOAPS), widow pensions, and disability pensions. | Employees' State Insurance (ESI), Provident Fund (PF), Maternity Benefit Act. |

### **Human Rights: The Moral Foundation**

**Human Rights** are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. They are the fundamental moral and ethical principles that govern our society.

#### **Core Principles of Human Rights:**
*   **Universal:** They belong to everyone, everywhere.
*   **Inalienable:** They cannot be taken away from you.
*   **Indivisible & Interdependent:** All rights are equally important and are connected. You cannot enjoy your civil rights (like freedom of speech) without your social rights (like the right to education).

#### **Key Historical Milestones:**
*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948:** Adopted by the United Nations after World War II, this is the foundational document of modern human rights. It outlines 30 fundamental rights, including the right to life, liberty, education, and an adequate standard of living.
*   **The Indian Constitution:** The Fundamental Rights (Part III) and Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV) in the Indian Constitution are heavily inspired by the UDHR.
*   **The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (India):** This act established the **National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)** and State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs) to investigate and inquire into human rights violations.

### **The Interconnection: Policy, Security, and Rights**

These three concepts are deeply linked in a "means-to-an-end" relationship.

**Human Rights** (e.g., the right to an adequate standard of living) provide the **moral and legal goal**.
**Social Policy** (e.g., the National Food Security Act) is the **government's plan** to achieve that goal.
**Social Security** measures (e.g., providing subsidized food grains through the PDS) are the **specific tools** used to implement the policy.

A **rights-based approach** to social welfare means that beneficiaries are seen as **"claimants"** who are entitled to services, not as passive **"recipients"** of charity.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Assistance vs. Insurance:** This is a classic exam topic. Remember: **Assistance** is based on need (means-tested). **Insurance** is based on contribution.
*   **Key Years:** Memorize these important dates: UDHR (1948) and the Protection of Human Rights Act in India (1993).
*   **NHRC:** Know that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body.
