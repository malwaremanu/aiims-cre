## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Defining Psychology: An Evolving Science**

The word "psychology" comes from the Greek words **Psyche**, meaning "soul" or "mind," and **Logos**, meaning "study." The definition of psychology has evolved over time:

1.  **Study of the Soul:** The earliest definition, rooted in philosophy.
2.  **Study of the Mind:** With the rise of philosophy, the focus shifted to the mind.
3.  **Study of Consciousness:** In the late 19th century, when psychology became a formal science, it was defined as the study of conscious experience.
4.  **Study of Behavior:** In the early 20th century, behaviorists argued that only observable behavior could be studied scientifically.
5.  **The Scientific Study of Behavior and Mental Processes:** This is the modern, comprehensive definition.
    *   **Behavior:** Any observable action (e.g., talking, crying, hitting a button).
    *   **Mental Processes:** Internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, memories, beliefs).

### **Major Schools of Thought in Psychology**

A "school of thought" is a particular perspective or approach to studying psychology.

| **School of Thought** | **Main Proponents** | **Core Ideas** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structuralism** (c. 1879) | Wilhelm Wundt, E.B. Titchener | Focused on breaking down consciousness into its basic **structures** or elements (like sensations and feelings) using a method called **introspection**. |
| **Functionalism** (c. 1890) | William James | Focused on the **function** or purpose of consciousness and behavior. Asked "Why do we do what we do?" and how it helps us adapt to our environment. |
| **Psychoanalysis** (c. 1900) | Sigmund Freud | Emphasized the powerful influence of the **unconscious mind**, repressed conflicts, and early childhood experiences on personality and behavior. |
| **Behaviorism** (c. 1913) | John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner | Argued that psychology should be the science of **observable behavior** only. Focused on how behavior is learned through conditioning (stimulus-response). |
| **Humanistic Psychology** (c. 1950s)| Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers | The "third force" that reacted against the determinism of Psychoanalysis and Behaviorism. Emphasized **free will, human potential, and self-actualization**. |
| **Cognitive Psychology** (c. 1960s)| (Many) | The "cognitive revolution" brought the focus back to **mental processes** like thinking, memory, perception, language, and problem-solving. |

### **Major Fields and Specializations in Psychology**

Psychology is a vast discipline with many applied fields.

*   **Clinical Psychology:** The largest field. Assesses, diagnoses, and treats mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia).
*   **Counseling Psychology:** Focuses on helping people navigate life's problems and transitions (e.g., career choices, marital problems, adjustment issues). Deals with less severe problems than clinical psychology.
*   **Social Psychology:** Studies how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by the presence of others. Topics include prejudice, conformity, and attraction.
*   **Developmental Psychology:** Studies the psychological changes that occur throughout the human lifespan, from conception to death ("womb to tomb").
*   **Industrial-Organizational (I-O) Psychology:** Applies psychological principles to the workplace to improve productivity, employee well-being, and organizational effectiveness.
*   **Educational Psychology:** Focuses on how people learn and the best ways to teach them.

### **Psychologist vs. Psychiatrist**

This is a very important and frequently confused distinction.

| **Feature** | **Psychologist (Clinical)** | **Psychiatrist** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Degree** | Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) or Psy.D. (Doctor of Psychology) | M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) |
| **Training Focus** | Research, psychological assessment, and psychotherapy ("talk therapy"). | General medicine, followed by specialization in psychiatry. |
| **Can Prescribe Medication?**| **No** (in most jurisdictions). | **Yes**. This is a key difference. |
| **Primary Approach** | Focuses on changing behavior and thought patterns through therapy. | Focuses on the biological and neurological aspects of mental illness; often uses medication as the primary treatment tool. |

A **Psychiatric Social Worker** often collaborates with both, providing therapy, case management, and focusing on the social and environmental factors affecting the client.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Modern Definition:** Remember the current definition: "The scientific study of behavior and mental processes."
*   **Founders & Schools:** Associate the key figures with their schools of thought (Wundt with Structuralism, James with Functionalism, Freud with Psychoanalysis, Watson with Behaviorism).
*   **Psychiatrist = M.D. = Medication:** This is the easiest way to remember the distinction. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medication.

4.  **d) Cognitive Psychologist:** Cognitive psychology is the branch that specifically studies mental processes like thinking, memory, and problem-solving. While a developmental psychologist also studies these, the question's focus on the processes themselves points to cognitive psychology.

6.  **b) Observable behavior:** Behaviorists believed that internal mental states were not scientific and that psychology should only study what can be seen and measured.
7.  **c) Industrial-Organizational Psychology:** I-O psychology is dedicated to the study of workplace behavior.
