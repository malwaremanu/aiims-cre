## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Why Build Your Vocabulary?**

Vocabulary is the collection of words you know. A larger vocabulary allows you to understand others and express yourself with greater clarity and precision. In a professional context like social work, using the right word—for instance, knowing the difference between "sympathy" and "empathy"—is crucial for effective communication.

*   **Sympathy:** Feeling pity or sorrow for someone else's misfortune. (Feeling *for* someone).
*   **Empathy:** The ability to understand and share the feelings of another. (Feeling *with* someone).

### **Effective Vocabulary Building Strategies**

1.  **Read Widely:** This is the most natural way to learn new words. Read articles, journals, and books related to social work, psychology, and sociology. Exposure to words in context helps with retention.
2.  **The Root Word Method:** Many English words are built from Greek and Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Learning these can help you decode hundreds of words.
    *   **Prefix:** Comes at the beginning (e.g., `mal-` means "bad," as in *maladaptive*).
    *   **Root:** The core of the word (e.g., `-path-` means "feeling," as in *empathy*).
    *   **Suffix:** Comes at the end (e.g., `-logy` means "study of," as in *psychology*).
3.  **Keep a Word Journal:** When you encounter a new word, write it down. Note its meaning, a synonym, an antonym, and use it in a sentence of your own. This active process aids memory.
4.  **Use Flashcards:** Write the word on one side and its meaning on the other. This is great for active recall and quick revision sessions.

### **Common Vocabulary Question Types**

#### **1. Synonyms and Antonyms**
*   **Synonyms:** Words that have a similar meaning.
    *   *Example:* **Alleviate** -> Relieve, Lessen, Mitigate.
*   **Antonyms:** Words that have the opposite meaning.
    *   *Example:* **Benevolent** -> Malevolent, Malicious, Unkind.

**Strategy:** Pay attention to the word's connotation (positive, negative, or neutral). This can help you eliminate options quickly. For example, if the word is positive, its synonym must also be positive.

#### **2. One-Word Substitution**
This involves replacing a descriptive phrase with a single, precise word.
*   *Example:* "A person who is recovering from an illness." -> **Convalescent**.
*   *Example:* "An irrational fear of open spaces." -> **Agoraphobia**.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Eliminate Options:** If you don't know the meaning of the word in the question, look at the options. Can you eliminate any that are clearly unrelated or have the wrong connotation?
*   **Break Down the Word:** Use the root-word method on the fly. If you see a word like "anachronism," you might recognize `ana-` (against) and `chron-` (time) and infer that it means something out of its proper time.
*   **Context is King:** If a word is in a sentence, the surrounding words provide valuable clues to its meaning.
