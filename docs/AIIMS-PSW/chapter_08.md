# **Chapter 8: Grammar Essentials**

## **Learning Objectives**

Upon completing this chapter, you will be able to:
*   Understand the fundamental rules of English grammar and their importance.
*   Identify the eight parts of speech and their specific functions within a sentence.
*   Apply the rules of subject-verb agreement and use verb tenses correctly.
*   Recognize and correct common grammatical errors in sentence construction.
*   Confidently solve error-spotting and sentence-correction questions in the exam.

## **Exam Relevance**

*   **Mark Weight:** High. Grammar is the backbone of the English language section. Expect 3-4 questions directly testing grammar rules through error spotting, fill-in-the-blanks, or sentence improvement formats.
*   **Topic Category:** English Language.
*   **Importance:** Critical. A strong foundation in grammar is essential not only for the direct questions but also for understanding Reading Comprehension passages and using vocabulary correctly.

## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Why Grammar Matters**

Grammar provides the structure for our language. Correct grammar ensures that our communication is clear, professional, and unambiguous. In a medical setting like AIIMS, a grammatical error in a patient's report could potentially lead to misunderstanding. For the CRE, mastering grammar is essential for a high score in the English section.

### **The Eight Parts of Speech**

Every word in a sentence has a job. The parts of speech are categories that tell us what job each word is doing.

| **Part of Speech** | **Function** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Noun** | Names a person, place, thing, or idea. | The **social worker** showed great **compassion**. |
| **2. Pronoun** | Replaces a noun to avoid repetition. | **She** spoke to the patient after **he** arrived. |
| **3. Verb** | Shows an action or a state of being. | The doctor **examines** the patient. The patient **is** calm. |
| **4. Adjective** | Describes a noun or pronoun. | It was a **difficult** case. The patient felt **anxious**. |
| **5. Adverb** | Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb. | The nurse acted **quickly**. The patient was **very** weak. |
| **6. Preposition** | Shows the relationship between words. | The file is **on** the table **in** the office. |
| **7. Conjunction** | Joins words, phrases, or clauses. | The patient was tired **but** cooperative. |
| **8. Interjection** | Expresses strong, sudden emotion. | **Alas!** The first attempt at treatment failed. |

### **Sentence Structure: The Building Blocks**

A simple sentence has at least a subject and a verb.
*   **Subject:** Who or what the sentence is about.
*   **Predicate:** The part of the sentence containing the verb, which tells us what the subject is or does.
    *   *Example:* **The patient** (Subject) **slept** (Predicate/Verb).
    *   *Example:* **The psychiatric social worker** (Subject) **conducted a detailed assessment** (Predicate).

### **Three Key Grammar Rules**

#### **1. Subject-Verb Agreement**
This is the most frequently tested grammar rule. The rule is simple:
*   Singular subjects take singular verbs (usually ending in '-s').
*   Plural subjects take plural verbs (usually without '-s').

*   **Correct:** The **doctor writes** a report. (Singular subject, singular verb)
*   **Incorrect:** The doctor write a report.
*   **Correct:** The **doctors write** reports. (Plural subject, plural verb)
*   **Incorrect:** The doctors writes reports.

**Tricky Cases:**
*   **Collective Nouns:** Words like *team, committee, family, group* can be singular or plural. If they act as one unit, use a singular verb. If they act as individuals, use a plural verb.
    *   *The team **is** ready for the presentation.* (The team as a single unit)
*   **Indefinite Pronouns:** Pronouns like *each, every, everyone, anyone, no one* are always singular.
    *   *Everyone **is** required to attend.*

#### **2. Correct Verb Tenses**
Tenses tell us when the action happened. Ensure the tense is consistent.
*   **Past:** I **saw** the patient yesterday.
*   **Present:** I **see** the patient every day.
*   **Future:** I **will see** the patient tomorrow.

**Common Error:** Mixing tenses in a sentence.
*   **Incorrect:** He **came** into the room and **sits** down.
*   **Correct:** He **came** into the room and **sat** down.

#### **3. Articles (A, An, The)**
*   **A/An (Indefinite Articles):** Used for general, non-specific nouns. 'A' is used before consonant sounds, 'An' before vowel sounds.
    *   *I need **a** pen.* (Any pen)
    *   *She is **an** honest person.* ('Honest' starts with a vowel sound)
*   **The (Definite Article):** Used for specific, particular nouns that have already been mentioned or are unique.
    *   *I need **the** pen that is on your desk.* (A specific pen)

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Spotting Errors:** When you see a sentence broken into parts (A), (B), (C), (D), read it as a whole first. Then, check for the most common errors in this order:
    1.  **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Find the subject and verb. Do they match?
    2.  **Tense Consistency:** Are all the verbs in the correct and consistent tense?
    3.  **Pronoun Errors:** Does each pronoun agree with the noun it replaces? (e.g., "Everyone should bring *their* book" is technically incorrect in formal English, it should be "*his or her* book").
    4.  **Preposition Errors:** Is the correct preposition used? (e.g., `comply with`, not `comply to`).

*   **Simplify the Sentence:** If a sentence is long and confusing, mentally remove the extra phrases to find the core subject and verb.
    *   *Example:* "The social worker, along with the entire team of doctors and nurses, **is** responsible for the patient's care." The subject is "social worker" (singular), so the verb is "is".

10. **She is the one person ______ can truly help you.**
    a) which
    b) who
    c) whom
    d) whose

## **Answer Key with Explanations**

1.  **b) B:** The error is in subject-verb agreement. The subject is "The team" (singular collective noun acting as a unit), so the verb should be singular: "has been working".
2.  **b) B:** The subject is "Each" (singular indefinite pronoun), which always takes a singular verb. The verb should be "was given".
3.  **c) C:** The error is in tense consistency. The first part of the sentence is in the past tense ("complained"). Therefore, the second verb should also be in the past tense: "called for".
4.  **a) A:** The error is in pronoun case. When a pronoun is part of the subject, it should be in the subjective case ("I"). Also, it is polite to mention the other person first. The correct phrase is "My colleague and I".
5.  **a) A:** The error is in the use of the article. "European" starts with a 'Y' sound (a consonant sound), not a vowel sound. Therefore, the correct article is "a European country".
6.  **b) are:** Here, the "committee" members are acting as individuals (they are unable to agree), not as a single unit. Therefore, a plural verb "are" is appropriate.
7.  **b) at:** The correct preposition is to be "angry at a thing" (like behavior) and "angry with a person". Since the object is "behavior", "at" is correct. However, "angry about" is also commonly used and accepted. In this context, "at" is the most precise choice. Let's re-evaluate. "Angry with" is used for people. "Angry at" is used for things, events, or situations. "Angry about" is also used for situations. "His friend's behavior" is a situation/thing. So "at" or "about" would be correct. Let's check common usage. "Angry at his behavior" is very common. "Angry about his behavior" is also common. Let's assume the question wants the most standard form. Let's check a grammar source. Fowler's Modern English Usage suggests 'at' for things and 'with' for people. So 'at' is the most formally correct.
8.  **b) have:** In a "neither...nor" construction, the verb agrees with the subject closest to it. The subject closest to the verb is "relatives" (plural), so the plural verb "have" is correct.
9.  **a) is:** "Work" is an uncountable noun, which is always treated as singular. Therefore, the correct verb is "is".
10. **b) who:** "Who" is the correct relative pronoun to use for a person when the person is the subject of the verb that follows ("who can help"). "Whom" is used when the person is the object.
