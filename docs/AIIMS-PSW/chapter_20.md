# **Chapter 20: Personality Theories & Defence Mechanisms**

## **Learning Objectives**

Upon completing this chapter, you will be able to:
*   Define personality and describe its key characteristics.
*   Explain the core ideas of Freud's psychoanalytic theory, including the Id, Ego, and Superego.
*   Define and identify common psychological defence mechanisms with examples.
*   Briefly describe the main ideas of Humanistic and Trait theories of personality.
*   Recognize the "Big Five" personality traits (OCEAN).

## **Exam Relevance**

*   **Mark Weight:** High. Personality theories are a major topic in psychology. Expect 2-3 questions, with a very high probability of them being on Freud's structural model (Id, Ego, Superego) and defence mechanisms.
*   **Topic Category:** Subject Knowledge - Psychology & Mental Health.
*   **Importance:** Critical. These theories provide the fundamental frameworks for understanding why people think, feel, and behave the way they do, which is central to any therapeutic or assessment role.

## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **What is Personality?**

**Personality** refers to an individual's unique and relatively stable patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character.

### **1. Psychoanalytic Theory (Sigmund Freud)**

Freud's theory was the first comprehensive theory of personality, and it emphasized the influence of the unconscious mind.

#### **Levels of Consciousness**
Freud compared the mind to an iceberg:
*   **The Conscious:** The small part above the water. It's what we are aware of at any given moment.
*   **The Preconscious:** The area just below the surface. It contains thoughts and memories that are not currently in consciousness but can be easily brought to mind.
*   **The Unconscious:** The vast, deep part of the iceberg. It is a reservoir of feelings, thoughts, urges, and memories that are outside of our conscious awareness. Freud believed the unconscious is the primary driver of our behavior.

#### **The Structure of Personality**
Freud proposed that personality is composed of three interacting systems:

| **Component** | **Operating Principle** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Id** | **Pleasure Principle** | The primitive, instinctual part of the mind that contains sexual and aggressive drives. It is entirely unconscious and seeks **immediate gratification** of all desires and urges. |
| **Ego** | **Reality Principle** | The "executive" of the personality. It develops to **mediate** between the unrealistic demands of the Id, the moralistic rules of the Superego, and the constraints of the real world. |
| **Superego** | **Morality Principle** | The moral compass of the personality. It represents our internalized ideals and standards that we acquire from our parents and society. It is our **conscience**, striving for perfection. |

**Intrapsychic Conflict:** Anxiety is the result of the constant conflict between the Id's impulses and the Superego's prohibitions. The Ego's job is to manage this conflict.

### **Defence Mechanisms**

When the Ego cannot resolve the conflict between the Id and Superego, it experiences anxiety. To protect itself, the Ego uses **unconscious** psychological strategies called defence mechanisms.

| **Defence Mechanism** | **Description** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Repression** | Pushing anxiety-provoking thoughts and feelings out of consciousness. (The most basic defence). | A person who survived a traumatic car crash has no memory of the event. |
| **Denial** | Refusing to acknowledge an anxiety-provoking reality. | A person diagnosed with a terminal illness insists the doctors are wrong. |
| **Projection** | Attributing one's own unacceptable impulses or qualities to others. | A person who is cheating on their spouse constantly accuses their spouse of being unfaithful. |
| **Rationalization** | Creating logical-sounding excuses for unacceptable behavior. | A student says, "I failed the test because the questions were unfair," instead of admitting they didn't study. |
| **Displacement** | Shifting impulses from an unacceptable target to a more acceptable or less threatening one. | After being criticized by your boss, you go home and yell at your family member. |
| **Sublimation** | Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable and constructive activities. (Considered a mature defence). | A person with strong aggressive urges becomes a competitive boxer. |
| **Reaction Formation**| Behaving in a way that is the exact opposite of one's true, unconscious feelings. | A person who harbors secret homosexual feelings becomes a vocal homophobe. |

### **2. Humanistic Theory (Maslow & Rogers)**

This perspective emphasizes human potential, free will, and the drive for personal growth.
*   **Abraham Maslow:** Proposed the **Hierarchy of Needs**, suggesting that we are motivated to fulfill basic needs before moving on to higher needs, with **self-actualization** (achieving one's full potential) at the top.
*   **Carl Rogers:** Believed that for a person to "grow," they need an environment that provides genuineness, acceptance (which he called **unconditional positive regard**), and empathy.

### **3. Trait Theory: The "Big Five"**

Trait theory focuses on identifying and measuring stable personality characteristics (traits). The most widely accepted model today is the "Big Five" or **OCEAN** model.

*   **O - Openness to Experience:** (Imaginative, curious vs. practical, conventional)
*   **C - Conscientiousness:** (Organized, disciplined vs. impulsive, careless)
*   **E - Extraversion:** (Sociable, fun-loving vs. sober, reserved)
*   **A - Agreeableness:** (Soft-hearted, trusting vs. ruthless, suspicious)
*   **N - Neuroticism:** (Anxious, insecure vs. calm, secure) (Also called Emotional Stability)

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Freud is High-Yield:** The Id, Ego, Superego, and defence mechanisms are the most frequently tested concepts from this chapter.
*   **Ego = Reality:** Remember the Ego operates on the Reality Principle, mediating between the Id and Superego.
*   **Defence Mechanisms are Unconscious:** A key feature is that the person is not aware they are using them.
*   **Sublimation is "Good":** Sublimation is considered the most mature and healthy defence mechanism.
*   **OCEAN:** Use the acronym OCEAN to remember the Big Five traits.
