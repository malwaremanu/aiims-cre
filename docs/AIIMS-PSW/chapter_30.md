*(Explanations for each question would be provided here. For brevity, a selection is shown.)*

*   **1. (D) Statue:** An author creates a book; a sculptor creates a statue. (Creator and Creation relationship).
*   **2. (B) 42:** The pattern is `n² + n`. (1²+1=2, 2²+2=6, 3²+3=12, 4²+4=20, 5²+5=30). The next term is 6²+6 = 42.
*   **3. (C) Circle:** The triangle, square, and rectangle are polygons (made of straight lines). The circle is not.
*   **5. (A) Mother:** "My mother's only daughter" is the woman herself. "His mother is me" means the woman is the man's mother.
*   **11. (C) 27:** The ratio is 3:4. The sum of the parts is 3+4=7. Divide the total sum by this: 63/7 = 9. The smaller number is 3 * 9 = 27.
*   **13. (B) 10 seconds:** First, convert speed to m/s: 36 km/hr = 36 * (5/18) m/s = 10 m/s. Time = Distance / Speed = 100m / 10 m/s = 10 seconds.

*   **25. (D) Sublimation:** This is the mature defence mechanism of channeling unacceptable impulses into socially valued activities.

*   **47. (B) ascribed; achieved:** Gender is an ascribed (involuntary) status; being a CEO is an achieved (earned) status.
*   **49. (C) Social Casework:** These "4 Ps" were articulated by H.H. Perlman to describe the components of casework.
