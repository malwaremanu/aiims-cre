## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Defining Professional Social Work**

Social work is not just about "doing good." It is a science-based, professional practice. The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) provides a global definition:

*"Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work."*

**Key Distinctions:**
*   **Charity vs. Professional Work:** Charity is often sporadic and driven by emotion. Professional social work is a systematic, planned activity based on a body of scientific knowledge and guided by a code of ethics.
*   **Goal:** The goal is not just to provide temporary relief (palliative), but to help individuals, groups, and communities enhance their capacity for social functioning and to advocate for a more just society (curative and preventive).

### **Core Values and Principles of Social Work**

Values are the "why" of social work—the beliefs that motivate the profession. Principles are the "how"—the guidelines for putting those values into action.

#### **Core Values (from the NASW Code of Ethics)**
1.  **Service:** To help people in need and address social problems.
2.  **Social Justice:** To challenge social injustice.
3.  **Dignity and Worth of the Person:** To respect the inherent value of every individual.
4.  **Importance of Human Relationships:** To recognize the central importance of human connection.
5.  **Integrity:** To behave in a trustworthy manner.
6.  **Competence:** To practice within one's areas of ability and to continuously develop professional expertise.

#### **Guiding Principles of Social Work (as formulated by Grace Mathew)**
These are the action-oriented principles used in direct practice.

| **Principle** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Individualization** | Recognizing and treating each client as a unique individual with different needs and strengths, not as a generic "case." |
| **2. Purposeful Expression of Feelings**| Encouraging clients to express their feelings freely, especially negative ones. |
| **3. Controlled Emotional Involvement**| The social worker remains sensitive to the client's feelings but does not get over-involved emotionally. They maintain a professional, objective perspective. |
| **4. Acceptance** | Accepting the client for who they are, with their strengths and weaknesses, without judgment. |
| **5. Non-Judgmental Attitude**| Not blaming the client for their situation or judging their actions based on personal values. |
| **6. Client Self-Determination**| Respecting the client's right to make their own choices and decisions. The worker's role is to guide, not to dictate. |
| **7. Confidentiality** | Keeping the information shared by the client private and secure. This is a cornerstone of trust. |

### **History of Social Work Education in India**

The beginning of professional social work in India is marked by the start of formal training for it.
*   **Landmark Year: 1936:** The **Sir Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work** was established in Mumbai. This was the first institution for social work education in India and marked the beginning of a secular, professional approach to the field.
*   **Current Name:** This institution is now known as the **Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS)** and remains a premier institution for social work in India.
*   **Post-1936 Growth:** Following the establishment of TISS, many other universities across India started schools of social work, initially influenced by the American model of casework and then gradually adapting to Indian social realities. This led to the development of specializations like Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Family & Child Welfare, and Criminology & Correctional Administration.

### **The Dynamics of the Worker-Client Relationship**

The relationship between the social worker and the client is the primary tool for change.

*   **Rapport:** The development of a comfortable, trusting, and collaborative relationship. It is the foundation upon which all social work intervention is built.
*   **Transference:** A concept from psychoanalysis, transference occurs when the **client unconsciously redirects feelings** experienced in an important earlier relationship (e.g., with a parent) towards the social worker. For example, a client might see the social worker as an authority figure and become overly compliant or rebellious.
*   **Counter-transference:** This is the reverse. It occurs when the **social worker unconsciously redirects their own feelings** or unresolved issues onto the client. For example, a social worker might feel overly protective of a client who reminds them of their own child. A professional social worker must be aware of counter-transference and manage it through self-awareness and clinical supervision to prevent it from harming the therapeutic process.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **TISS, 1936:** This is a high-yield fact. Remember the year, the original name, and its significance.
*   **Principles are Paramount:** The seven principles of social work (Individualization, Acceptance, etc.) are frequently tested. Understand the meaning of each one.
*   **Acceptance vs. Approval:** Remember that the principle of "Acceptance" means accepting the person, not necessarily approving of their behavior.
*   **Counter-transference is the Worker's Issue:** A common point of confusion is between transference and counter-transference. Remember: **Counter-transference** is about the **C**ounsellor's (worker's) feelings.
