*   **Importance:** Critical. A deep understanding of the methods of social work is essential for any aspiring social worker and is a core component of the syllabus.

## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Introduction to Social Work Methods**

If social work values and principles are the "why," then the methods of social work are the "how." They are the systematic, orderly, and scientific ways in which a professional social worker intervenes to help people solve their psychosocial problems.

The methods are broadly classified into two categories:

1.  **Primary Methods (or Direct Methods):** These involve direct, face-to-face contact with the client system.
    *   Social Casework
    *   Social Group Work
    *   Community Organization

2.  **Secondary Methods (or Indirect/Enabling Methods):** These are methods that support the primary methods and create a better environment for practice.
    *   Social Action
    *   Social Welfare Administration
    *   Social Work Research

### **Primary Method 1: Social Casework**

*   **Definition:** Social Casework is the method of helping individuals on a **one-to-one basis** to resolve their personal and social problems. The client is an individual (or a family unit treated as one).
*   **Pioneer:** **Mary Richmond**, whose 1917 book "Social Diagnosis" laid the scientific foundation for this method.
*   **The Components (The 4 Ps):** H.H. Perlman described casework as a process involving a **P**erson with a **P**roblem who comes to a **P**lace (a social agency) where a professional representative (the caseworker) helps them by a **P**rocess.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Intake/Study:** Gathering information about the client and their problem.
    2.  **Psychosocial Diagnosis/Assessment:** Analyzing the information to understand the nature of the problem.
    3.  **Treatment/Intervention:** Implementing a plan of action to solve the problem.
    4.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the effectiveness of the intervention.
    5.  **Termination:** Ending the professional relationship once the goals are met.

### **Primary Method 2: Social Group Work**

*   **Definition:** Social Group Work is a method where individuals are helped to improve their social functioning through **purposeful group experiences**. The group itself is the primary tool for change.
*   **Key Idea:** Individuals in a group can learn from each other, gain mutual support, and practice new social skills in a safe environment.
*   **Uses:** Support groups (e.g., for caregivers of Alzheimer's patients), therapeutic groups (e.g., for addiction recovery), and skill-development groups (e.g., for teaching social skills to adolescents).
*   **Stages of Group Development (Tuckman's Model):**
    1.  **Forming:** The group comes together; members are polite and uncertain.
    2.  **Storming:** Conflict arises as members assert their individuality and roles.
    3.  **Norming:** The group establishes rules and norms; cohesion begins.
    4.  **Performing:** The group works effectively and collaboratively towards its goals.
    5.  **Adjourning:** The group disbands after its purpose is fulfilled.

### **Primary Method 3: Community Organization**

*   **Definition:** Community Organization is a macro-level method where the **community is the client**. The social worker helps the community to identify its common needs, find resources, and take collective action to address those needs.
*   **Pioneer:** Key contributions were made by **Murray Ross**.
*   **Core Principles:**
    *   **Felt Needs:** The work should be based on the needs that the community itself feels are important.
    *   **Participation:** The community members must be actively involved in the entire process.
    *   **Self-Help:** The goal is to empower the community to solve its own problems.
*   **Models of Community Organization (by Jack Rothman):**
    *   **Locality Development:** Focuses on community participation and building consensus. The process is more important than the outcome. (e.g., a neighborhood clean-up drive).
    *   **Social Planning:** A technical, expert-driven process of problem-solving. The focus is on finding the most rational solution. (e.g., a city planning department designing a new transport system).
    *   **Social Action:** A confrontational approach used to challenge existing power structures and bring about fundamental changes in policy. It is about shifting power to the disadvantaged. (e.g., a protest movement demanding policy change).

### **The Secondary (Enabling) Methods**

1.  **Social Action:** As described in Rothman's model, this method aims to achieve social justice by mobilizing people to challenge and change unjust systems. It involves advocacy, propaganda, boycotts, and protests. **Example:** The Narmada Bachao Andolan.
2.  **Social Welfare Administration:** This is the process of **transforming social policy into social services**. It involves the management of social agencies, including planning, budgeting, staffing, directing, and reporting (POSDCORB).
3.  **Social Work Research:** This is the systematic investigation used to build knowledge for the social work profession and to evaluate the effectiveness of its interventions. It helps in understanding social problems and finding out "what works."

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Primary vs. Secondary:** This is a fundamental classification. Be able to list the three primary and three secondary methods.
*   **Person-Problem-Place-Process:** Associate this "4 Ps" formula with Social Casework.
*   **Rothman's 3 Models:** Know the names and the key focus of each model of Community Organization: Locality Development (process/cooperation), Social Planning (task/expert), Social Action (power/confrontation).
*   **Keywords are Key:**
    *   Casework -> **Individual**
    *   Group Work -> **Group**
    *   Community Organization -> **Community**
    *   Social Action -> **Movement/Change**
    *   Administration -> **Agency/Management**
    *   Research -> **Knowledge/Evaluation**

## **Chapter Summary (Key Takeaways)**

*   The methods of social work are the professional, systematic procedures used to address psychosocial problems.
*   The **Primary Methods** involve direct practice: **Social Casework** (with individuals), **Social Group Work** (with groups), and **Community Organization** (with communities).
