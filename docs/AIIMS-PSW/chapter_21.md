## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **What is an Attitude?**

In social psychology, an **attitude** is a learned evaluation of a person, object, or issue. It influences our thoughts and actions. Attitudes can be positive, negative, or neutral.

#### **The ABC Model of Attitudes**
Attitudes are generally understood to have three components:

1.  **A - Affective Component:** This refers to your **feelings** or emotional reactions toward the attitude object.
    *   *Example:* Fear of snakes. The *fear* is the affective component.

2.  **B - Behavioral Component:** This is the way you **act** or behave in relation to the attitude object.
    *   *Example:* Running away when you see a snake. The *action* of running is the behavioral component.

3.  **C - Cognitive Component:** This consists of your **thoughts** and beliefs about the attitude object.
    *   *Example:* The belief that "all snakes are dangerous." The *belief* is the cognitive component.

### **Prejudice, Stereotypes, and Discrimination**

These three concepts are related to negative attitudes but are distinct.

| **Concept** | **Component** | **Definition** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stereotype** | **Cognitive** (Belief) | A generalized **belief** about a group of people. It's a mental shortcut that assigns certain traits to all members of a group, ignoring individual differences. | "All librarians are quiet and shy." |
| **Prejudice** | **Affective** (Feeling) | A preconceived negative **feeling** or attitude towards a person based solely on their membership in a particular group. | Feeling dislike or suspicion towards someone simply because of their nationality. |
| **Discrimination**| **Behavioral** (Action) | Unjustifiable negative **behavior** or action towards a member of a group. It is prejudice put into action. | Denying someone a job or housing because of their race, religion, or gender. |

**The Relationship:** **Stereotypes** (beliefs) can fuel **Prejudice** (feelings), which can lead to **Discrimination** (actions).

### **What are the Sources of Prejudice?**

Prejudice doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It has deep roots.

1.  **Social Sources:**
    *   **Social Inequality:** Prejudice can be used by dominant groups to justify existing social hierarchies and inequalities. For example, believing a group is "naturally inferior" can be used to justify paying them lower wages.
    *   **In-group and Out-group:** We have a natural tendency to divide the world into "us" (the in-group) and "them" (the out-group). We often exhibit **in-group bias**, which is the tendency to favor our own group.

2.  **Emotional Sources:**
    *   **Scapegoat Theory:** This theory suggests that when things go wrong, people may look for someone to blame. Frustration and aggression are often displaced onto a vulnerable group (the scapegoat) that is not the real source of the problem. For example, blaming immigrants for economic downturns.

3.  **Cognitive Sources:**
    *   **Categorization:** Our brains naturally categorize information to simplify the world. When we categorize people, we often overestimate the similarities within groups and the differences between groups, which is the foundation of stereotyping.
    *   **Just-World Phenomenon:** This is the tendency for people to believe that the world is just and that people, therefore, get what they deserve and deserve what they get. This can lead to blaming the victim ("She was poor because she was lazy").

### **How Can Prejudice Be Reduced?**

*   **The Contact Hypothesis:** Proposed by Gordon Allport, this is one of the most influential theories. It suggests that prejudice can be reduced by direct contact between groups, but **only under specific conditions**:
    1.  **Equal Status:** Both groups must have equal status in the situation.
    2.  **Common Goals:** Both groups must work together towards a shared goal.
    3.  **Intergroup Cooperation:** The situation must require cooperation, not competition.
    4.  **Institutional Support:** The contact must be supported by authorities, laws, or customs.
*   **Education:** Educating people about different cultures and the realities of prejudice can help reduce stereotypes.
*   **Empathy:** Encouraging people to take the perspective of an out-group member can increase empathy and reduce prejudice.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **ABC Model:** Remember **A**ffect (Feeling), **B**ehavior (Action), **C**ognition (Belief).
*   **Prejudice vs. Discrimination:** This is the most critical distinction. **Prejudice is a feeling/attitude.** **Discrimination is an action/behavior.**
*   **Scapegoat Theory:** This is a frequently tested concept. It's about blaming a powerless out-group for the in-group's problems.
*   **Contact Hypothesis Conditions:** Remember that simple contact is not enough to reduce prejudice. The conditions (equal status, common goals, etc.) are crucial.

## **Chapter Summary (Key Takeaways)**

*   Attitudes are evaluations of things and are composed of Affective (feeling), Behavioral (action), and Cognitive (belief) components.
*   **Stereotypes** are beliefs, **Prejudice** is a feeling, and **Discrimination** is an action. This is a critical distinction.
*   Prejudice arises from social inequalities, emotional needs (like scapegoating), and cognitive shortcuts (like categorization).
*   Prejudice can be reduced through intergroup contact, but only under specific conditions of equality, cooperation, and shared goals.
*   As a social worker, understanding these dynamics is key to challenging stigma and advocating for social justice.
