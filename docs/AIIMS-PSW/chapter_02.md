## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **Structure of the AIIMS CRE Exam**

The AIIMS CRE is conducted as a Computer-Based Test (CBT). The examination for the post of Psychiatric Social Worker is designed to assess a candidate's aptitude and domain knowledge comprehensively.

*   **Exam Duration:** 90 minutes
*   **Total Questions:** 100 Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)
*   **Total Marks:** 100
*   **Exam Medium:** English

The exam paper is divided into two distinct parts:

**Table: AIIMS CRE Exam Structure**

| **Part** | **Subject** | **Number of MCQs** | **Maximum Marks** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Part A** | General Aptitude & Awareness | 40 | 40 |
| **Part B** | Domain-Specific Knowledge | 60 | 60 |
| **Total** | | **100** | **100** |

### **Detailed Syllabus Breakdown**

#### **Part A: General Section (40 Marks)**

This section is common for many posts and tests your general aptitude. It is crucial for a good rank.

*   **General Intelligence & Reasoning (10 Marks):** Topics include analogies, series (number, alphabet), spatial visualization, problem-solving, and logical reasoning.
*   **General Awareness (10 Marks):** Current affairs (national and international), basic science, Indian history and geography, and general knowledge about computers.
*   **Quantitative Aptitude (10 Marks):** Arithmetic, percentages, profit & loss, time & work, simple & compound interest, and data interpretation.
*   **English Language & Comprehension (10 Marks):** Grammar, vocabulary (synonyms, antonyms), sentence structure, and reading comprehension.

#### **Part B: Domain-Specific Section (60 Marks)**

This is the most critical section for a Psychiatric Social Worker post. The syllabus is designed to test your foundational and applied knowledge in subjects relevant to the role. The questions will be based on the educational qualifications required for the post, which include a Master's in Social Work or Psychology.

**Key Subject Areas:**
*   **Professional Social Work:** History, philosophy, principles, methods (casework, group work, community organization), and social welfare administration.
*   **Psychology & Mental Health:** Basic psychology, developmental psychology, abnormal psychology, psychopathology, and concepts of mental health and illness (based on ICD/DSM).
*   **Sociology & Social Psychology:** Social structure, social institutions, culture, socialization, attitudes, communication, and group dynamics.
*   **Human Rights & Social Legislation:** Knowledge of key acts like the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, Persons with Disabilities Act, and rights of vulnerable groups.

### **Marking Scheme**

Understanding the marking scheme is vital for developing an effective answering strategy.

*   **Correct Answer:** +1 Mark
*   **Incorrect Answer:** -1/3 Mark (Negative Marking)
*   **Unattempted Question:** 0 Marks

The presence of **negative marking** means that blind guessing is counterproductive. It is better to leave a question unanswered if you have no idea about the correct option.

### **A Phase-Wise Preparation Strategy**

A structured approach is essential to cover the vast syllabus effectively.

**Diagram: Three-Phased Preparation (Explained in Words)**

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation Building (First 2 Months):**
    *   **Goal:** To gain conceptual clarity.
    *   **Action:** Thoroughly read the standard textbooks mentioned in the reference list (e.g., Sanjay Bhattacharya for Social Work, Baron & Misra for Psychology). Make concise notes. Do not focus on MCQs yet.

2.  **Phase 2: Application & Practice (Next 2 Months):**
    *   **Goal:** To apply knowledge and improve question-solving skills.
    *   **Action:** Start solving MCQs from practice books and previous year papers (UGC-NET, other SW exams). Analyze your mistakes. This phase connects theory with application.

3.  **Phase 3: Revision & Mock Tests (Last Month):**
    *   **Goal:** To enhance speed, accuracy, and exam temperament.
    *   **Action:** Take full-length mock tests in a timed, exam-like environment. Analyze your performance in detail—identify weak areas, time taken per question, and accuracy. Revise your notes intensively.

## **Real-life Examples or Case Applications**

**Scenario 1: Study Plan for a Working Professional**
*   **Challenge:** Limited time.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Dedicate 2-3 hours daily on weekdays (focus on one topic).
    *   Utilize weekends for longer study sessions (6-8 hours), covering larger topics and practicing MCQs.
    *   Use digital notes for quick revision during commutes or breaks.
    *   Prioritize domain-specific subjects over general aptitude if time is short, but do not ignore the latter completely.

**Scenario 2: Study Plan for a Full-Time Student**
*   **Advantage:** Ample time.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Create a daily schedule of 6-8 hours of focused study.
    *   Divide the day into slots: 3 hours for domain subjects, 2 hours for the general section, and 2 hours for practice/revision.
    *   Can afford to go into greater depth in each topic.
    *   Should aim to complete at least 20-30 full-length mock tests.

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Accuracy over Attempt:** Due to negative marking, your goal should be to maximize your score, not the number of attempts. A score of 70 with 90% accuracy is far better than a score of 80 with 70% accuracy.
*   **Don't Neglect Part A:** The 40 marks from the general section are often the rank-decider. Consistent, light preparation for this section from the beginning is crucial.
*   **Master the Core:** For Part B, focus on the core methods of social work, theories of personality, basics of psychopathology, and key social legislation. These are high-yield areas.
*   **Analyze Previous Papers:** Go through previous papers of AIIMS, NIMHANS, and UGC-NET (Social Work/Psychology) to understand the pattern, question style, and important topics.
