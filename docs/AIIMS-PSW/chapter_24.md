## **Detailed Theory / Concepts**

### **What is Society?**

In sociology, a **society** is a group of people who live in a defined geographical area, who interact with one another, and who share a common culture. It is the web of social relationships that connects individuals.

### **The Components of Social Structure**

Social structure is the underlying framework of society, consisting of the patterned social arrangements that shape our interactions. Its main components are:

1.  **Status:** A socially defined position that a person occupies in a society.
    *   **Ascribed Status:** A social position that is assigned to a person at birth or involuntarily later in life. One has little or no choice in the matter.
        *   *Examples:* Race, gender, ethnicity, son/daughter, teenager.
    *   **Achieved Status:** A social position that a person takes on voluntarily and that reflects personal ability and effort.
        *   *Examples:* Doctor, student, spouse, athlete, criminal.
    *   **Master Status:** A status that has exceptional importance for a person's social identity, often shaping their entire life. It can be ascribed (e.g., being a member of a royal family) or achieved (e.g., being a famous scientist).

2.  **Role:** The set of behaviors, obligations, and privileges expected of someone who holds a particular status.
    *   You **hold** a status, but you **play** a role.
    *   **Role Conflict:** Conflict between the roles connected to **two or more different statuses**.
        *   *Example:* A police officer (status 1) who finds that their own child (status 2) has committed a crime. The role of "officer" (to uphold the law) conflicts with the role of "parent" (to protect their child).
    *   **Role Strain:** Tension between the roles connected to a **single status**.
        *   *Example:* A college professor (single status) experiences strain between their role as a teacher (spending time with students) and their role as a researcher (needing to publish papers).

3.  **Social Groups:** Two or more people who identify with one another and interact on a regular basis.

4.  **Social Institutions:** The major, organized spheres of social life, or societal subsystems, established to meet basic human needs. The five major social institutions are:
    *   The Family
    *   The Education System
    *   The Economy
    *   The Government (Polity)
    *   Religion

### **Major Sociological Perspectives**

These are broad theoretical frameworks for understanding how society works.

| **Perspective** | **Key Proponents** | **Level of Analysis** | **Core Idea** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structural-Functionalism**| Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons | **Macro** | Society is a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. It sees society as a living organism. It focuses on the **functions** of social structures. |
| **Conflict Theory** | Karl Marx | **Macro** | Society is an arena of **inequality** that generates conflict and change. It focuses on how factors like class, race, and gender are linked to the unequal distribution of money, power, and prestige. |
| **Symbolic Interactionism**| George H. Mead, Erving Goffman | **Micro** | Society is the product of the **everyday interactions** of individuals. It focuses on how people use **symbols** (like language) to create shared meanings and construct social reality. |

### **Social Stratification and Mobility**

*   **Social Stratification:** A system by which a society ranks categories of people into a hierarchy. This inequality is built into the social structure and determines people's access to resources and opportunities. Stratification can be based on:
    *   **Class:** (Socioeconomic status)
    *   **Caste:** (A rigid system based on birth, as historically in India)
    *   **Race and Ethnicity**
    *   **Gender**
*   **Social Mobility:** A change in one's position within the social hierarchy. It can be **upward** (moving to a higher class), **downward** (moving to a lower class), or **horizontal** (changing jobs at the same class level).

## **AIIMS CRE-Oriented Tips & Tricks**

*   **Status vs. Role:** This is a classic distinction. Remember: A status is a **position** you hold (noun). A role is the **behavior** you perform (verb).
*   **Ascribed vs. Achieved:** Ascribed = **A**ssigned at birth. Achieved = **A**cquired through effort.
*   **Role Conflict vs. Role Strain:** **C**onflict is between a **C**ouple (two or more) of statuses. **S**train is within a **S**ingle status.
*   **The 3 Perspectives:**
    *   **Functionalism** = **F**unction, stability, order.
    *   **Conflict** = **C**onflict, inequality, power.
    *   **Symbolic Interactionism** = **S**ymbols, face-to-face interaction, meaning.

## **Chapter Summary (Key Takeaways)**

*   Society is a web of social relationships, and its structure is built from statuses, roles, groups, and institutions.
*   A **status** is a position you hold (ascribed or achieved), while a **role** is the behavior you perform. **Role conflict** is between two statuses; **role strain** is within one status.
*   Sociology offers three major perspectives to analyze society:
    *   **Functionalism** focuses on stability and order (macro).
    *   **Conflict Theory** focuses on inequality and power struggles (macro).
    *   **Symbolic Interactionism** focuses on everyday interactions and meanings (micro).
*   **Social stratification** is the hierarchical ranking of people in society, and **social mobility** is the movement within that hierarchy.
