        <h1>AIIMS CRE Psychiatric Social Worker - Detailed Topic Study Guide</h1>
<p>---</p>
<h2>TOPIC 1: FREUD'S PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT THEORY</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>Freud believed that personality develops through 5 stages from birth to adulthood. At each stage, a different body part (erogenous zone) becomes the center of pleasure and conflict. If a person gets too much or too little gratification at a stage, they become "fixated" and develop specific personality traits.</p>
<p>**The 5 Stages:**</p>
<p>1. **ORAL STAGE (0-18 months)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Mouth (eating, sucking, chewing)</li>
<li>Task: Learn to trust caregivers</li>
<li>Fixation Result: Oral-aggressive (aggressive, argumentative) or Oral-dependent (needy, dependent)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. **ANAL STAGE (18 months - 3 years)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Bowel/bladder control (toilet training)</li>
<li>Task: Develop control and independence</li>
<li>Fixation Result: Anal-retentive (perfectionist, orderly, stubborn) or Anal-expulsive (messy, rebellious)</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **PHALLIC STAGE (3-6 years)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Genitals, self-discovery</li>
<li>Major Conflict: Oedipus complex (boys) / Electra complex (girls)</li>
<li>Oedipus: Boy wants mother, competes with father, resolves by identifying with father</li>
<li>Electra: Girl wants father, competes with mother, resolves by identifying with mother</li>
<li>Penis Envy: Freud believed girls feel inferior for lacking penis</li>
</ul>
<p>4. **LATENCY STAGE (6 years - puberty)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Dormant sexual period</li>
<li>Task: Develop skills, friendships, school learning</li>
<li>Sexual energy sublimated into productive activities</li>
</ul>
<p>5. **GENITAL STAGE (Puberty - adulthood)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Mature sexual relationships</li>
<li>Goal: Balance needs with adult responsibilities</li>
<li>Healthy outcome: Mature, capable of love and work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Most Asked Questions Pattern</h3>
<ul>
<li>Which stage involves toilet training? (Anal Stage)</li>
<li>Oedipus complex occurs in which stage? (Phallic Stage)</li>
<li>What is latency period? (Sexual dormancy period)</li>
<li>Anal fixation leads to which traits? (Perfectionism, orderliness, stubbornness)</li>
<li>Who proposed psychosexual development? (Sigmund Freud)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Terms to Remember</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Libido**: Sexual/life energy that motivates behavior</li>
<li>**Erogenous Zone**: Body parts sensitive to pleasure</li>
<li>**Fixation**: Getting stuck at a stage due to unresolved conflict</li>
<li>**Regression**: Going back to earlier stage under stress</li>
<li>**Sublimation**: Channeling sexual energy into productive work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Connection to Other Topics</h3>
<p>**→ Connect to ERIKSON'S THEORY**</p>
<ul>
<li>Both propose stage development</li>
<li>Erikson expanded Freud's approach to full lifespan</li>
<li>Erikson focused on social relationships; Freud on sexual drives</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ Connect to DEFENCE MECHANISMS**</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixations cause ego to use defence mechanisms</li>
<li>Anal fixation individuals use rationalization and reaction formation</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ Connect to NORMAL vs ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR**</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe fixations → neurotic symptoms</li>
<li>Understanding stage helps explain client's current behavior patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ ARISTOTLE CONNECTION**</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotle: Development = achieving virtue at each life stage</li>
<li>Freud: Development = resolving conflict at each psychosexual stage</li>
<li>Both: Childhood experiences shape adult character</li>
</ul>
<p>---</p>
<h2>TOPIC 2: ERIKSON'S PSYCHOSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THEORY</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>Erik Erikson built on Freud's work but made 3 major changes:</p>
<p>1. Extended development to ENTIRE LIFESPAN (not just childhood)</p>
<p>2. Focused on SOCIAL relationships, not sexual drives</p>
<p>3. Each stage has a CRISIS (challenge) that must be resolved</p>
<p>Each stage presents two opposite forces. Success at resolving them creates psychological strength; failure creates weakness.</p>
<p>**The 8 Stages:**</p>
<p>| Stage | Age | Crisis | Success Outcome | Failure Outcome |</p>
<p>|-------|-----|--------|-----------------|-----------------|</p>
<p>| 1 | 0-18 months | Trust vs Mistrust | Hope, security | Fear, anxiety |</p>
<p>| 2 | 18 months-3 years | Autonomy vs Shame/Doubt | Will, independence | Shame, self-doubt |</p>
<p>| 3 | 3-5 years | Initiative vs Guilt | Purpose, confidence | Guilt, inhibition |</p>
<p>| 4 | 6 years-puberty | Industry vs Inferiority | Competence, skill | Inferiority complex |</p>
<p>| 5 | 12-18 years | Identity vs Role Confusion | Fidelity, identity | Confusion, uncertainty |</p>
<p>| 6 | 18-25 years | Intimacy vs Isolation | Love, relationships | Loneliness, isolation |</p>
<p>| 7 | 25-65 years | Generativity vs Stagnation | Care, contribution | Selfishness, stagnation |</p>
<p>| 8 | 65+ years | Ego Integrity vs Despair | Wisdom, acceptance | Despair, regret |</p>
<h3>Stage-by-Stage Explanation</h3>
<p>**Stage 1: TRUST vs MISTRUST (Infancy)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby depends completely on caregivers</li>
<li>If caregivers respond to needs: Baby develops trust, feels safe</li>
<li>If caregivers neglect: Baby develops mistrust, feels unsafe</li>
<li>**For PSW**: Understanding client's basic trust issues; impact of early neglect</li>
</ul>
<p>**Stage 4: INDUSTRY vs INFERIORITY (School Age)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Child learns skills through school and activities</li>
<li>Success → feels competent, worthy</li>
<li>Repeated failure → develops inferiority complex</li>
<li>**For PSW**: Why some children give up; importance of success experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>**Stage 5: IDENTITY vs ROLE CONFUSION (Adolescence)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Most critical for Psychiatric Social Work!</li>
<li>Adolescent asks: "Who am I? What do I believe? Where do I fit?"</li>
<li>Success → clear sense of identity, direction</li>
<li>Failure → identity confusion, unclear values, role confusion</li>
<li>**For PSW**: Reason for adolescent mental health issues; identity crisis common</li>
</ul>
<p>**Stage 6: INTIMACY vs ISOLATION (Young Adulthood)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Young adult seeks close relationships</li>
<li>Can only achieve intimacy after identity is formed (Stage 5)</li>
<li>Success → meaningful relationships, love</li>
<li>Failure → loneliness, isolation, fear of commitment</li>
</ul>
<p>**Stage 7: GENERATIVITY vs STAGNATION (Middle Adulthood)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Person contributes to next generation (children, work, mentoring)</li>
<li>Success → feels life has meaning, leaves legacy</li>
<li>Failure → feels life is pointless, self-centered</li>
<li>**For PSW**: Understand midlife crisis; importance of meaningful work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Most Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Which stage involves "Who am I?" question? (Stage 5: Adolescence)</li>
<li>Trust vs Mistrust develops in which stage? (Stage 1: Infancy)</li>
<li>Intimacy vs Isolation is in which stage? (Stage 6: Young Adulthood)</li>
<li>How many stages in Erikson's theory? (8 stages)</li>
<li>What is generativity? (Contributing to next generation)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Connection to Other Topics</h3>
<p>**→ Connect to FREUD'S THEORY**</p>
<ul>
<li>Erikson based on Freud but extended it</li>
<li>Erikson less focus on sexual drives, more on social needs</li>
<li>Both: Early experiences matter; stage-based development</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ Connect to ATTACHMENT THEORY**</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust vs Mistrust = Secure vs Insecure attachment</li>
<li>Early bonding affects later relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ Connect to MENTAL HEALTH**</p>
<ul>
<li>Erikson's framework explains common mental health issues</li>
<li>Identity confusion → depression, anxiety in adolescents</li>
<li>Lack of generativity → midlife depression</li>
</ul>
<p>**→ ARISTOTLE CONNECTION**</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotle: "We are what we repeatedly do"</li>
<li>Erikson: Repeated experiences at each stage shape personality</li>
<li>Both: Development = gradual formation of character</li>
</ul>

<h2>TOPIC 5: DEFENCE MECHANISMS & PSYCHOLOGICAL COPING</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>When facing stressful or threatening situations, our mind uses **defence mechanisms** - automatic, unconscious tricks to protect our ego (self-image) from anxiety.</p>
<p>**Key Point**: Defence mechanisms are NOT conscious; we don't realize we're using them.</p>
<h3>The 3 Levels of Defence Mechanisms</h3>
<p>**LEVEL 1: IMMATURE DEFENCES** (Used by children and adults under stress)</p>
<p>1. **PROJECTION**</p>

</ul>
<p>2. **DISPLACEMENT**</p>
<ul>
<li>**What**: Expressing feelings toward safe target instead of real target</li>

<li>**Real Situation**: Moving emotional reaction from real source to substitute</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **ACTING OUT**</p>
<ul>
<li>**What**: Expressing unconscious impulses through actions instead of words</li>
<li>**Example**: Angry person punches wall instead of talking about anger</li>

</ul>
<p>---</p>
<p>**LEVEL 2: NEUROTIC DEFENCES** (Used by most people sometimes)</p>
<p>1. **REPRESSION**</p>
<ul>
<li>**What**: Pushing threatening memories into unconscious</li>
<li>**Example**: Childhood abuse victim "forgetting" the abuse</li>
<li>**Real Situation**: Can't remember event even though it happened</li>
<li>**Note**: Different from SUPPRESSION (conscious forgetting)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. **RATIONALIZATION**</p>
<ul>
<li>**What**: Creating logical explanations for illogical feelings/behaviors</li>
<li>**Example**: "I'm late because traffic was bad" (when really you overslept)</li>
<li>**Real Situation**: Justifying behavior with false reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **INTELLECTUALIZATION**</p>
<ul>

<h2>TOPIC 6: NORMAL vs ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>**Question**: When is behavior "abnormal"?</p>
<p>**Answer**: When it's MALADAPTIVE, causes DISTRESS, and violates SOCIAL NORMS.</p>
<p>**Key Point**: No single criterion defines abnormality. Use MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES.</p>
<h3>4 Criteria for Defining Abnormality</h3>
<p>| Criterion | Description | Limitation |</p>
<p>|-----------|-------------|-----------|</p>
<p>| **Statistical Rarity** | Behavior is statistically unusual/rare | Genius-level intelligence is rare but normal |</p>
<p>| **Personal Distress** | Behavior causes suffering to person | Some disturbed people don't feel distressed |</p>
<p>| **Violation of Social Norms** | Behavior breaks social rules | Social norms vary by culture and time |</p>
<p>| **Maladaptation/Dysfunction** | Behavior prevents functioning | What counts as dysfunction varies |</p>
<h3>Three Models of Abnormality</h3>
<p>**MODEL 1: MEDICAL MODEL**</p>
<ul>
<li>**View**: Abnormality = mental illness = brain disease</li>
<li>**Cause**: Biological (genetic, neurochemical)</li>
<li>**Treatment**: Medical (drugs, hospitalization)</li>
<li>**Problem**: Ignores psychological and social factors</li>
</ul>
<p>**MODEL 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL MODEL**</p>
<ul>
<li>**View**: Abnormality = learned maladaptive behavior or thought patterns</li>
<li>**Cause**: Past experiences, trauma, learned associations</li>
<li>**Treatment**: Therapy, counseling, behavior modification</li>
<li>**Problem**: Ignores biological and social factors</li>
</ul>
<p>**MODEL 3: SOCIAL MODEL**</p>
<ul>
<li>**View**: Abnormality = failure to adapt to society's expectations</li>
<li>**Cause**: Social factors (poverty, discrimination, stress)</li>
<li>**Treatment**: Social change, environmental modifications</li>
<li>**Problem**: May ignore individual pathology</li>
</ul>
<h3>BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL (Recommended approach)</h3>
<p>**Integrated Model** considering all three factors:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Biological Factors</p>
<p>(genetics, brain chemistry, neurotransmitters)</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>↙    ↓    ↘</p>
<p>Psychological ← ABNORMALITY → Social Factors</p>
<p>Factors               (environment, culture,</p>
<p>(trauma, beliefs,      socioeconomic, relationships)</p>
<p>learning)</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>**Example - Depression**:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Biological**: Low serotonin</li>
<li>**Psychological**: Negative thought patterns, past trauma</li>
<li>**Social**: Unemployment, relationship problems, isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>**Treatment**: Combination of medication (biological), therapy (psychological), social support (social).</p>
<h3>Examples of Normal Behavior That Might Seem Abnormal</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Grief** after loss: Sad, withdrawn, crying = NORMAL (not depression unless severe)</li>
<li>**Anxiety** before exam: Nervous, worried = NORMAL</li>
<li>**Shyness**: Introversion, social anxiety = NORMAL (unless severe social phobia)</li>
<li>**Belief Systems**: Religious practices, cultural rituals = NORMAL if culturally appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Abnormal Behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Hallucinations**: Hearing voices others can't hear + causes distress = ABNORMAL</li>
<li>**Delusions**: Believing things against all evidence = ABNORMAL</li>
<li>**Compulsions**: Uncontrollable repetitive behaviors = ABNORMAL</li>
<li>**Parasuicidal**: Self-harm to cope = ABNORMAL</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment Tools for Abnormality</h3>
<p>1. **Clinical Interview**: Professional conversation</p>
<p>2. **Psychological Tests**: IQ tests, personality tests</p>
<p>3. **Medical Tests**: Blood tests, brain imaging</p>
<p>4. **Social Assessment**: Family, work, social functioning</p>
<p>5. **DSM-5 / ICD-11**: Diagnostic manuals</p>
<h3>Most Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abnormality defined by what criteria? (Multiple: distress, dysfunction, deviance, rarity)</li>
<li>Statistical rarity alone defines abnormality? (No)</li>
<li>Biopsychosocial model includes what? (Biological, Psychological, Social)</li>
<li>Grief after loss is abnormal? (No, it's normal unless severe)</li>
<li>Three models of abnormality are? (Medical, Psychological, Social)</li>
</ul>

<h2>TOPIC 7: SOCIAL WORK PRINCIPLES & PROFESSIONAL VALUES</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>Principles are the FUNDAMENTAL GUIDELINES that govern ALL social work practice, regardless of method or setting.</p>
<p>Think of them like the "rules" of ethical practice that social workers must follow.</p>
<h3>7 Core Principles of Social Work</h3>
<p>**1. PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUALIZATION**</p>
<p>**What**: Treat each client as unique person; no two cases are identical.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess unique factors: age, culture, beliefs, abilities, challenges</li>
<li>Don't use "one-size-fits-all" solutions</li>
<li>Tailor intervention to specific client</li>
<li>Recognize individual differences despite similar presenting problems</li>
</ul>
<p>**Example**: Two clients with depression may need different approaches</p>
<ul>
<li>Client A: Needs medication + cognitive therapy</li>
<li>Client B: Needs counseling + social support + job training</li>
</ul>
<p>---</p>
<p>**2. PRINCIPLE OF PURPOSEFUL EXPRESSION**</p>
<p>**What**: Create conditions where client can freely express thoughts, feelings, and concerns.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active listening without interruption</li>
<li>Create safe, non-judgmental environment</li>
<li>Ask open-ended questions</li>
<li>Respect client's pace of sharing</li>
<li>Use body language showing interest</li>
</ul>
<p>**Example**: Let client tell their story fully before offering advice; don't rush or interrupt.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>**3. PRINCIPLE OF CONTROLLED EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT**</p>
<p>**What**: Show empathy and caring WITHOUT losing objectivity and professional boundaries.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathy ≠ Sympathy (understand vs feel sorry for)</li>
<li>Maintain professional distance</li>
<li>Be warm but not personal friends</li>
<li>Manage counter-transference</li>
<li>Know when to refer to another worker if too emotionally involved</li>
</ul>
<p>**Tricky Balance**: Care about client BUT don't get too involved that judgment becomes clouded.</p>
<p>**Example**: "I understand this is painful for you" (empathy) vs "That's terrible, I feel so sad for you" (too much sympathy).</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>**4. PRINCIPLE OF ACCEPTANCE**</p>
<p>**What**: Respect client's worth and dignity REGARDLESS of personal views about their behavior/beliefs.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate person from behavior</li>
<li>Accept client even if you disagree with actions</li>
<li>Don't judge or moralize</li>
<li>Create safe space where client feels valued</li>
<li>Accept client's pace of change</li>
</ul>
<p>**NOT Condoning**: You accept the person but may not accept all behaviors.</p>
<p>**Example**: Client is ex-convict or sex worker. Accept them as worthy person even if you don't approve of past actions.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>**5. PRINCIPLE OF NON-JUDGMENTAL ATTITUDE**</p>
<p>**What**: Set aside personal biases, prejudices, and moral judgments in assessment and treatment.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of own biases</li>
<li>Actively work to suspend judgment</li>
<li>Assess objectively based on facts</li>
<li>Respect diverse values and beliefs</li>
<li>Recognize cultural differences</li>
<li>Don't impose own values</li>
</ul>
<p>**Hardest Principle**: Requires ongoing self-awareness and reflection.</p>
<p>**Example**: Client believes in arranged marriage. Even if you prefer love marriage, don't judge or criticize their choice.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>**6. PRINCIPLE OF CONFIDENTIALITY**</p>
<p>**What**: Protect client's privacy. Information shared in professional relationship is confidential.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep client information private</li>
<li>Don't gossip or share unnecessarily</li>
<li>Write records securely</li>
<li>Seek permission before sharing</li>
<li>Know exceptions: Risk of harm, abuse, court orders, breaking law</li>
</ul>
<p>**Important Exception**: If client is danger to self/others or there's abuse, MUST breach confidentiality.</p>
<p>**Example**: Client tells you about suicidal plans. Must inform psychiatrist/family despite confidentiality principle.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>**7. PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION**</p>
<p>**What**: Respect client's right to make own decisions about their life.</p>
<p>**How to Apply**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide information about options</li>
<li>Support client's choices (even if you disagree)</li>
<li>Don't impose solutions</li>
<li>Client drives pace and goals of intervention</li>
<li>Recognize client's autonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>**Limit**: When choice causes harm (endangering self/others), may need to limit self-determination.</p>
<p>**Example**: Client decides to leave husband. Even if you think she should stay, support her decision if it's her choice.</p>
<p>---</p>

<h2>TOPIC 8: THERAPEUTIC CONCEPTS - TRANSFERENCE & COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE</h2>
<h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
<p>**TRANSFERENCE**: Client's emotional reaction to therapist BASED ON PAST RELATIONSHIPS, not based on therapist's actual behavior.</p>
<p>**COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE**: Therapist's emotional reaction to client.</p>
<p>Both are NORMAL, EXPECTED, and therapeutically USEFUL if recognized and managed.</p>
<h3>TRANSFERENCE in Detail</h3>
<p>**What is Transference?**</p>
<p>Client projects feelings, attitudes, expectations from past relationships (especially parents/authority figures) ONTO the therapist/social worker.</p>
<p>**Key Point**: It's about CLIENT'S PAST, not about therapist's actual behavior.</p>
<p>**Common Transference Patterns:**</p>
<p>1. **Paternal/Maternal Transference**</p>
<ul>
<li>Client treats worker like parent</li>
<li>Seeks approval/disapproval like child</li>
<li>Example: Adult client seeking validation from worker like seeking from parent</li>
</ul>
<p>2. **Romantic Transference**</p>
<ul>
<li>Client develops attraction or romantic feelings</li>
<li>Based on client's needs, not real relationship</li>
<li>Example: Client idealizing worker, wanting closer relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **Negative Transference**</p>
<ul>
<li>Client becomes angry, resistant, suspicious</li>
<li>Transfers past negative experiences onto worker</li>
<li>Example: Client antagonistic if worker reminds them of authority figure who hurt them</li>
</ul>
<p>4. **Authoritative Transference**</p>
<ul>
<li>Client sees worker as expert/authority</li>
<li>Complies or resists against authority</li>
<li>Example: Client follows all advice unthinkingly or rebels against all suggestions</li>
</ul>
<h3>COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE in Detail</h3>
<p>**What is Counter-transference?**</p>
<p>Therapist's emotional and behavioral responses to client, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings (attraction, anger, boredom)</li>
<li>Reactions (wanting to rescue, becoming punitive)</li>
<li>Biases triggered by client</li>
</ul>
<p>**Why Counter-transference Happens?**</p>
<ul>
<li>Therapist is human with own issues</li>
<li>Client reminds therapist of someone from their past</li>
<li>Client's behavior triggers therapist's vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>**Examples of Counter-transference:**</p>
<ul>
<li>Therapist attracted to client</li>
<li>Therapist overprotective of vulnerable client</li>
<li>Therapist impatient with demanding client</li>
<li>Therapist identifying too much with client's struggles</li>
<li>Therapist avoiding certain clients</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Manage Transference & Counter-transference</h3>
<p>**Steps to Manage TRANSFERENCE:**</p>
<p>1. **RECOGNIZE IT**</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice unusual emotional reactions from client</li>
<li>Client's behavior inconsistent with situation</li>
<li>Patterns emerging</li>
</ul>
<p>2. **UNDERSTAND IT**</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is this coming from?</li>
<li>What past experience is being repeated?</li>
<li>What need is client expressing?</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **USE IT THERAPEUTICALLY**</p>
<ul>
<li>Gently point out pattern: "I notice you seem angry with me like..."</li>
<li>Help client understand connection to past</li>
<li>Insight → Change in patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>4. **DON'T ACT ON IT**</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't reciprocate romantic transference</li>
<li>Don't become the idealized parent</li>
<li>Maintain professional boundaries</li>
<li>Don't collude with resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>**Steps to Manage COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE:**</p>
<p>1. **RECOGNIZE YOUR FEELINGS**</p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of emotional reactions</li>
<li>Identify what specifically triggers you</li>
<li>Don't act immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>2. **REFLECT ON SOURCE**</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does this client trigger me?</li>
<li>What do they remind me of?</li>
<li>What's MY issue here?</li>
</ul>
<p>3. **MANAGE IT PROFESSIONALLY**</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't let feelings guide your treatment</li>
<li>Maintain objectivity</li>
<li>Seek supervision if needed</li>
<li>Sometimes refer to another worker if too involved</li>
</ul>
<p>4. **USE IT FOR UNDERSTANDING**</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-transference can provide insight into client</li>
<li>If you feel rejected, maybe client rejects others too</li>
<li>Clues about client's impact on relationships</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples Showing Both</h3>
<p>**Scenario**: Female client with absent father meets male social worker.</p>
<p>**Client's Transference (to worker)**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeks approval/attention</li>
<li>Tests if he'll abandon her like father</li>
<li>Initially idealized; later disappointed</li>
<li>Angry or withdrawn if he doesn't respond emotionally</li>
</ul>
<p>**Worker's Counter-transference (to client)**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feels protective/parental</li>
<li>Wants to "fix" her father issues</li>
<li>Gets frustrated if she doesn't improve</li>
<li>Notices he looks forward to her sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>**Healthy Management**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker recognizes patterns</li>
<li>Helps client see: "You seem to want approval from me like you wanted from father"</li>
<li>Worker maintains professional boundaries</li>
<li>Supports client's healing of father relationship</li>
</ul>
<h3>Most Asked Questions</h3>
