## TOPIC 1: FREUD'S PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT THEORY

### Simple Explanation
Freud believed that personality develops through 5 stages from birth to adulthood. At each stage, a different body part (erogenous zone) becomes the center of pleasure and conflict. If a person gets too much or too little gratification at a stage, they become "fixated" and develop specific personality traits.

**The 5 Stages:**

1. **ORAL STAGE (0-18 months)**
   - Focus: Mouth (eating, sucking, chewing)
   - Task: Learn to trust caregivers
   - Fixation Result: Oral-aggressive (aggressive, argumentative) or Oral-dependent (needy, dependent)

2. **ANAL STAGE (18 months - 3 years)**
   - Focus: Bowel/bladder control (toilet training)
   - Task: Develop control and independence
   - Fixation Result: Anal-retentive (perfectionist, orderly, stubborn) or Anal-expulsive (messy, rebellious)

3. **PHALLIC STAGE (3-6 years)**
   - Focus: Genitals, self-discovery
   - Major Conflict: Oedipus complex (boys) / Electra complex (girls)
   - Oedipus: Boy wants mother, competes with father, resolves by identifying with father
   - Electra: Girl wants father, competes with mother, resolves by identifying with mother
   - Penis Envy: Freud believed girls feel inferior for lacking penis

4. **LATENCY STAGE (6 years - puberty)**
   - Focus: Dormant sexual period
   - Task: Develop skills, friendships, school learning
   - Sexual energy sublimated into productive activities

5. **GENITAL STAGE (Puberty - adulthood)**
   - Focus: Mature sexual relationships
   - Goal: Balance needs with adult responsibilities
   - Healthy outcome: Mature, capable of love and work

### Most Asked Questions Pattern
- Which stage involves toilet training? (Anal Stage)
- Oedipus complex occurs in which stage? (Phallic Stage)
- What is latency period? (Sexual dormancy period)
- Anal fixation leads to which traits? (Perfectionism, orderliness, stubbornness)
- Who proposed psychosexual development? (Sigmund Freud)

### Key Terms to Remember
- **Libido**: Sexual/life energy that motivates behavior
- **Erogenous Zone**: Body parts sensitive to pleasure
- **Fixation**: Getting stuck at a stage due to unresolved conflict
- **Regression**: Going back to earlier stage under stress
- **Sublimation**: Channeling sexual energy into productive work

### Connection to Other Topics

**→ Connect to ERIKSON'S THEORY**
- Both propose stage development
- Erikson expanded Freud's approach to full lifespan
- Erikson focused on social relationships; Freud on sexual drives

**→ Connect to DEFENCE MECHANISMS**
- Fixations cause ego to use defence mechanisms
- Anal fixation individuals use rationalization and reaction formation

**→ Connect to NORMAL vs ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR**
- Severe fixations → neurotic symptoms
- Understanding stage helps explain client's current behavior patterns

**→ ARISTOTLE CONNECTION**
- Aristotle: Development = achieving virtue at each life stage
- Freud: Development = resolving conflict at each psychosexual stage
- Both: Childhood experiences shape adult character

---

## TOPIC 2: ERIKSON'S PSYCHOSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THEORY

### Simple Explanation
Erik Erikson built on Freud's work but made 3 major changes:
1. Extended development to ENTIRE LIFESPAN (not just childhood)
2. Focused on SOCIAL relationships, not sexual drives
3. Each stage has a CRISIS (challenge) that must be resolved

Each stage presents two opposite forces. Success at resolving them creates psychological strength; failure creates weakness.

**The 8 Stages:**

| Stage | Age | Crisis | Success Outcome | Failure Outcome |
|-------|-----|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0-18 months | Trust vs Mistrust | Hope, security | Fear, anxiety |
| 2 | 18 months-3 years | Autonomy vs Shame/Doubt | Will, independence | Shame, self-doubt |
| 3 | 3-5 years | Initiative vs Guilt | Purpose, confidence | Guilt, inhibition |
| 4 | 6 years-puberty | Industry vs Inferiority | Competence, skill | Inferiority complex |
| 5 | 12-18 years | Identity vs Role Confusion | Fidelity, identity | Confusion, uncertainty |
| 6 | 18-25 years | Intimacy vs Isolation | Love, relationships | Loneliness, isolation |
| 7 | 25-65 years | Generativity vs Stagnation | Care, contribution | Selfishness, stagnation |
| 8 | 65+ years | Ego Integrity vs Despair | Wisdom, acceptance | Despair, regret |

### Stage-by-Stage Explanation

**Stage 1: TRUST vs MISTRUST (Infancy)**
- Baby depends completely on caregivers
- If caregivers respond to needs: Baby develops trust, feels safe
- If caregivers neglect: Baby develops mistrust, feels unsafe
- **For PSW**: Understanding client's basic trust issues; impact of early neglect

**Stage 4: INDUSTRY vs INFERIORITY (School Age)**
- Child learns skills through school and activities
- Success → feels competent, worthy
- Repeated failure → develops inferiority complex
- **For PSW**: Why some children give up; importance of success experiences

**Stage 5: IDENTITY vs ROLE CONFUSION (Adolescence)**
- Most critical for Psychiatric Social Work!
- Adolescent asks: "Who am I? What do I believe? Where do I fit?"
- Success → clear sense of identity, direction
- Failure → identity confusion, unclear values, role confusion
- **For PSW**: Reason for adolescent mental health issues; identity crisis common

**Stage 6: INTIMACY vs ISOLATION (Young Adulthood)**
- Young adult seeks close relationships
- Can only achieve intimacy after identity is formed (Stage 5)
- Success → meaningful relationships, love
- Failure → loneliness, isolation, fear of commitment

**Stage 7: GENERATIVITY vs STAGNATION (Middle Adulthood)**
- Person contributes to next generation (children, work, mentoring)
- Success → feels life has meaning, leaves legacy
- Failure → feels life is pointless, self-centered
- **For PSW**: Understand midlife crisis; importance of meaningful work

### Most Asked Questions
- Which stage involves "Who am I?" question? (Stage 5: Adolescence)
- Trust vs Mistrust develops in which stage? (Stage 1: Infancy)
- Intimacy vs Isolation is in which stage? (Stage 6: Young Adulthood)
- How many stages in Erikson's theory? (8 stages)
- What is generativity? (Contributing to next generation)

### Connection to Other Topics

**→ Connect to FREUD'S THEORY**
- Erikson based on Freud but extended it
- Erikson less focus on sexual drives, more on social needs
- Both: Early experiences matter; stage-based development

**→ Connect to ATTACHMENT THEORY**
- Trust vs Mistrust = Secure vs Insecure attachment
- Early bonding affects later relationships

**→ Connect to MENTAL HEALTH**
- Erikson's framework explains common mental health issues
- Identity confusion → depression, anxiety in adolescents
- Lack of generativity → midlife depression

**→ ARISTOTLE CONNECTION**
- Aristotle: "We are what we repeatedly do"
- Erikson: Repeated experiences at each stage shape personality
- Both: Development = gradual formation of character

## TOPIC 5: DEFENCE MECHANISMS & PSYCHOLOGICAL COPING

### Simple Explanation

When facing stressful or threatening situations, our mind uses **defence mechanisms** - automatic, unconscious tricks to protect our ego (self-image) from anxiety.

**Key Point**: Defence mechanisms are NOT conscious; we don't realize we're using them.

### The 3 Levels of Defence Mechanisms

**LEVEL 1: IMMATURE DEFENCES** (Used by children and adults under stress)

1. **PROJECTION**
   - **What**: Attributing own unacceptable feelings to others
   - **Example**: "I'm not angry at you, YOU are angry at me"
   - **Real Situation**: Aggressive person accuses others of being aggressive

2. **DISPLACEMENT**
   - **What**: Expressing feelings toward safe target instead of real target
   - **Example**: Boss criticizes you at work; you go home and yell at spouse
   - **Real Situation**: Moving emotional reaction from real source to substitute

3. **ACTING OUT**
   - **What**: Expressing unconscious impulses through actions instead of words
   - **Example**: Angry person punches wall instead of talking about anger
   - **Real Situation**: Physical expression of emotions instead of verbal

4. **REGRESSION**
   - **What**: Going back to earlier, childish behaviors
   - **Example**: Adult sucking thumb when stressed; reverting to childlike speech
   - **Real Situation**: Under extreme stress, acting younger than actual age

5. **IDENTIFICATION**
   - **What**: Adopting characteristics of someone else to reduce anxiety
   - **Example**: Abused child copying abuser's behavior
   - **Real Situation**: Incorporating another's traits into own personality

---

**LEVEL 2: NEUROTIC DEFENCES** (Used by most people sometimes)

1. **REPRESSION**
   - **What**: Pushing threatening memories into unconscious
   - **Example**: Childhood abuse victim "forgetting" the abuse
   - **Real Situation**: Can't remember event even though it happened
   - **Note**: Different from SUPPRESSION (conscious forgetting)

2. **RATIONALIZATION**
   - **What**: Creating logical explanations for illogical feelings/behaviors
   - **Example**: "I'm late because traffic was bad" (when really you overslept)
   - **Real Situation**: Justifying behavior with false reasoning

3. **INTELLECTUALIZATION**
   - **What**: Discussing emotional topics in detached, intellectual way
   - **Example**: Person discussing death of loved one without any emotion
   - **Real Situation**: Avoiding emotional pain through intellectual analysis

4. **REACTION FORMATION**
   - **What**: Expressing opposite of what you truly feel
   - **Example**: Overly nice to person you actually hate
   - **Real Situation**: Masking true emotion with opposite emotion

---

**LEVEL 3: MATURE DEFENCES** (Adaptive, healthy; used by psychologically healthy people)

1. **SUBLIMATION**
   - **What**: Channeling negative emotions/energy into productive activities
   - **Example**: Processing anger through sports, art, music, or work
   - **Real Situation**: Converting emotional pain into creative output
   - **Most Healthy Defence**: Acknowledged and studied extensively

2. **HUMOUR** (Appropriate, not hurtful)
   - **What**: Using humor to cope with stress without hurting others
   - **Example**: Making light joke about your own mistake
   - **Real Situation**: Laugh at situation to reduce tension
   - **Not**: Making fun of others or cruel jokes

3. **SUPPRESSION**
   - **What**: Consciously postponing dealing with impulses/conflicts
   - **Example**: "I'm upset about something but I'll talk about it after the meeting"
   - **Real Situation**: Conscious decision to delay processing emotion

4. **ALTRUISM**
   - **What**: Helping others to work through own conflicts
   - **Example**: Working with homeless population after own difficult period
   - **Real Situation**: Turning own suffering into service

5. **ANTICIPATION**
   - **What**: Realistic planning for future challenges
   - **Example**: Worrying about exam so you study hard
   - **Real Situation**: Anxiety motivates preparation

## TOPIC 6: NORMAL vs ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR

### Simple Explanation

**Question**: When is behavior "abnormal"?

**Answer**: When it's MALADAPTIVE, causes DISTRESS, and violates SOCIAL NORMS.

**Key Point**: No single criterion defines abnormality. Use MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES.

### 4 Criteria for Defining Abnormality

| Criterion | Description | Limitation |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Statistical Rarity** | Behavior is statistically unusual/rare | Genius-level intelligence is rare but normal |
| **Personal Distress** | Behavior causes suffering to person | Some disturbed people don't feel distressed |
| **Violation of Social Norms** | Behavior breaks social rules | Social norms vary by culture and time |
| **Maladaptation/Dysfunction** | Behavior prevents functioning | What counts as dysfunction varies |

### Three Models of Abnormality

**MODEL 1: MEDICAL MODEL**
- **View**: Abnormality = mental illness = brain disease
- **Cause**: Biological (genetic, neurochemical)
- **Treatment**: Medical (drugs, hospitalization)
- **Problem**: Ignores psychological and social factors

**MODEL 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL MODEL**
- **View**: Abnormality = learned maladaptive behavior or thought patterns
- **Cause**: Past experiences, trauma, learned associations
- **Treatment**: Therapy, counseling, behavior modification
- **Problem**: Ignores biological and social factors

**MODEL 3: SOCIAL MODEL**
- **View**: Abnormality = failure to adapt to society's expectations
- **Cause**: Social factors (poverty, discrimination, stress)
- **Treatment**: Social change, environmental modifications
- **Problem**: May ignore individual pathology

### BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL (Recommended approach)

**Integrated Model** considering all three factors:

```
Biological Factors
(genetics, brain chemistry, neurotransmitters)
          ↓
     ↙    ↓    ↘
Psychological ← ABNORMALITY → Social Factors
Factors               (environment, culture,
(trauma, beliefs,      socioeconomic, relationships)
learning)
```

**Example - Depression**:
- **Biological**: Low serotonin
- **Psychological**: Negative thought patterns, past trauma
- **Social**: Unemployment, relationship problems, isolation

**Treatment**: Combination of medication (biological), therapy (psychological), social support (social).

### Examples of Normal Behavior That Might Seem Abnormal

- **Grief** after loss: Sad, withdrawn, crying = NORMAL (not depression unless severe)
- **Anxiety** before exam: Nervous, worried = NORMAL
- **Shyness**: Introversion, social anxiety = NORMAL (unless severe social phobia)
- **Belief Systems**: Religious practices, cultural rituals = NORMAL if culturally appropriate

### Examples of Abnormal Behavior

- **Hallucinations**: Hearing voices others can't hear + causes distress = ABNORMAL
- **Delusions**: Believing things against all evidence = ABNORMAL
- **Compulsions**: Uncontrollable repetitive behaviors = ABNORMAL
- **Parasuicidal**: Self-harm to cope = ABNORMAL

### Assessment Tools for Abnormality

1. **Clinical Interview**: Professional conversation
2. **Psychological Tests**: IQ tests, personality tests
3. **Medical Tests**: Blood tests, brain imaging
4. **Social Assessment**: Family, work, social functioning
5. **DSM-5 / ICD-11**: Diagnostic manuals

### Most Asked Questions
- Abnormality defined by what criteria? (Multiple: distress, dysfunction, deviance, rarity)
- Statistical rarity alone defines abnormality? (No)
- Biopsychosocial model includes what? (Biological, Psychological, Social)
- Grief after loss is abnormal? (No, it's normal unless severe)
- Three models of abnormality are? (Medical, Psychological, Social)

### Connection to Other Topics

**→ Connect to MENTAL HEALTH CONCEPTS**
- Normal-abnormal on CONTINUUM
- Mental health is more than just "no abnormality"

**→ Connect to PERSONALITY THEORIES**
- Understanding development explains variations in behavior
- Fixations (Freud) or unresolved crises (Erikson) → abnormal patterns

**→ Connect to DEFENCE MECHANISMS**
- Using immature/rigid defences → appears abnormal
- Understanding defences contextualizes behavior

**→ Connect to PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS**
- Abnormality assessment → DSM-5 diagnosis
- PSW must understand what's normal in context

**→ ARISTOTLE CONNECTION**
- Aristotle: Virtue = mean between extremes
- Abnormality = Extreme behavior (too much or too little)
- Virtue (normal) = Balanced response
- Example: Courage = between cowardice and recklessness

## TOPIC 7: SOCIAL WORK PRINCIPLES & PROFESSIONAL VALUES

### Simple Explanation

Principles are the FUNDAMENTAL GUIDELINES that govern ALL social work practice, regardless of method or setting.

Think of them like the "rules" of ethical practice that social workers must follow.

### 7 Core Principles of Social Work

**1. PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUALIZATION**

**What**: Treat each client as unique person; no two cases are identical.

**How to Apply**:
- Assess unique factors: age, culture, beliefs, abilities, challenges
- Don't use "one-size-fits-all" solutions
- Tailor intervention to specific client
- Recognize individual differences despite similar presenting problems

**Example**: Two clients with depression may need different approaches
- Client A: Needs medication + cognitive therapy
- Client B: Needs counseling + social support + job training

---

**2. PRINCIPLE OF PURPOSEFUL EXPRESSION**

**What**: Create conditions where client can freely express thoughts, feelings, and concerns.

**How to Apply**:
- Active listening without interruption
- Create safe, non-judgmental environment
- Ask open-ended questions
- Respect client's pace of sharing
- Use body language showing interest

**Example**: Let client tell their story fully before offering advice; don't rush or interrupt.

---

**3. PRINCIPLE OF CONTROLLED EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT**

**What**: Show empathy and caring WITHOUT losing objectivity and professional boundaries.

**How to Apply**:
- Empathy ≠ Sympathy (understand vs feel sorry for)
- Maintain professional distance
- Be warm but not personal friends
- Manage counter-transference
- Know when to refer to another worker if too emotionally involved

**Tricky Balance**: Care about client BUT don't get too involved that judgment becomes clouded.

**Example**: "I understand this is painful for you" (empathy) vs "That's terrible, I feel so sad for you" (too much sympathy).

---

**4. PRINCIPLE OF ACCEPTANCE**

**What**: Respect client's worth and dignity REGARDLESS of personal views about their behavior/beliefs.

**How to Apply**:
- Separate person from behavior
- Accept client even if you disagree with actions
- Don't judge or moralize
- Create safe space where client feels valued
- Accept client's pace of change

**NOT Condoning**: You accept the person but may not accept all behaviors.

**Example**: Client is ex-convict or sex worker. Accept them as worthy person even if you don't approve of past actions.

---

**5. PRINCIPLE OF NON-JUDGMENTAL ATTITUDE**

**What**: Set aside personal biases, prejudices, and moral judgments in assessment and treatment.

**How to Apply**:
- Be aware of own biases
- Actively work to suspend judgment
- Assess objectively based on facts
- Respect diverse values and beliefs
- Recognize cultural differences
- Don't impose own values

**Hardest Principle**: Requires ongoing self-awareness and reflection.

**Example**: Client believes in arranged marriage. Even if you prefer love marriage, don't judge or criticize their choice.

---

**6. PRINCIPLE OF CONFIDENTIALITY**

**What**: Protect client's privacy. Information shared in professional relationship is confidential.

**How to Apply**:
- Keep client information private
- Don't gossip or share unnecessarily
- Write records securely
- Seek permission before sharing
- Know exceptions: Risk of harm, abuse, court orders, breaking law

**Important Exception**: If client is danger to self/others or there's abuse, MUST breach confidentiality.

**Example**: Client tells you about suicidal plans. Must inform psychiatrist/family despite confidentiality principle.

---

**7. PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION**

**What**: Respect client's right to make own decisions about their life.

**How to Apply**:
- Provide information about options
- Support client's choices (even if you disagree)
- Don't impose solutions
- Client drives pace and goals of intervention
- Recognize client's autonomy

**Limit**: When choice causes harm (endangering self/others), may need to limit self-determination.

**Example**: Client decides to leave husband. Even if you think she should stay, support her decision if it's her choice.

---

## TOPIC 8: THERAPEUTIC CONCEPTS - TRANSFERENCE & COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE

### Simple Explanation

**TRANSFERENCE**: Client's emotional reaction to therapist BASED ON PAST RELATIONSHIPS, not based on therapist's actual behavior.

**COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE**: Therapist's emotional reaction to client.

Both are NORMAL, EXPECTED, and therapeutically USEFUL if recognized and managed.

### TRANSFERENCE in Detail

**What is Transference?**

Client projects feelings, attitudes, expectations from past relationships (especially parents/authority figures) ONTO the therapist/social worker.

**Key Point**: It's about CLIENT'S PAST, not about therapist's actual behavior.

**Common Transference Patterns:**

1. **Paternal/Maternal Transference**
   - Client treats worker like parent
   - Seeks approval/disapproval like child
   - Example: Adult client seeking validation from worker like seeking from parent

2. **Romantic Transference**
   - Client develops attraction or romantic feelings
   - Based on client's needs, not real relationship
   - Example: Client idealizing worker, wanting closer relationship

3. **Negative Transference**
   - Client becomes angry, resistant, suspicious
   - Transfers past negative experiences onto worker
   - Example: Client antagonistic if worker reminds them of authority figure who hurt them

4. **Authoritative Transference**
   - Client sees worker as expert/authority
   - Complies or resists against authority
   - Example: Client follows all advice unthinkingly or rebels against all suggestions

### COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE in Detail

**What is Counter-transference?**

Therapist's emotional and behavioral responses to client, including:
- Feelings (attraction, anger, boredom)
- Reactions (wanting to rescue, becoming punitive)
- Biases triggered by client

**Why Counter-transference Happens?**
- Therapist is human with own issues
- Client reminds therapist of someone from their past
- Client's behavior triggers therapist's vulnerabilities

**Examples of Counter-transference:**
- Therapist attracted to client
- Therapist overprotective of vulnerable client
- Therapist impatient with demanding client
- Therapist identifying too much with client's struggles
- Therapist avoiding certain clients

### How to Manage Transference & Counter-transference

**Steps to Manage TRANSFERENCE:**

1. **RECOGNIZE IT**
   - Notice unusual emotional reactions from client
   - Client's behavior inconsistent with situation
   - Patterns emerging

2. **UNDERSTAND IT**
   - Where is this coming from?
   - What past experience is being repeated?
   - What need is client expressing?

3. **USE IT THERAPEUTICALLY**
   - Gently point out pattern: "I notice you seem angry with me like..."
   - Help client understand connection to past
   - Insight → Change in patterns

4. **DON'T ACT ON IT**
   - Don't reciprocate romantic transference
   - Don't become the idealized parent
   - Maintain professional boundaries
   - Don't collude with resistance

**Steps to Manage COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE:**

1. **RECOGNIZE YOUR FEELINGS**
   - Be aware of emotional reactions
   - Identify what specifically triggers you
   - Don't act immediately

2. **REFLECT ON SOURCE**
   - Why does this client trigger me?
   - What do they remind me of?
   - What's MY issue here?

3. **MANAGE IT PROFESSIONALLY**
   - Don't let feelings guide your treatment
   - Maintain objectivity
   - Seek supervision if needed
   - Sometimes refer to another worker if too involved

4. **USE IT FOR UNDERSTANDING**
   - Counter-transference can provide insight into client
   - If you feel rejected, maybe client rejects others too
   - Clues about client's impact on relationships

### Examples Showing Both

**Scenario**: Female client with absent father meets male social worker.

**Client's Transference (to worker)**:
- Seeks approval/attention
- Tests if he'll abandon her like father
- Initially idealized; later disappointed
- Angry or withdrawn if he doesn't respond emotionally

**Worker's Counter-transference (to client)**:
- Feels protective/parental
- Wants to "fix" her father issues
- Gets frustrated if she doesn't improve
- Notices he looks forward to her sessions

**Healthy Management**:
- Worker recognizes patterns
- Helps client see: "You seem to want approval from me like you wanted from father"
- Worker maintains professional boundaries
- Supports client's healing of father relationship
